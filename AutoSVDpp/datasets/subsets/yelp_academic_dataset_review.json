We went on Sunday evening as a party of 4 for my birthday dinner. We were seated promptly upon arrival (we had a reservation). The restaurant is LOUD, so not a good option for a business meeting or those who are hard of hearing or don't like screaming to converse. Started with some cocktails and all were tasty. The complimentary bread and butter are delicious. We started with the zeppoles and marinated olives, both of which were very yummy. The beet salad was simple but very yummy. Hubs and I shared the pork belly steam buns, fig flatbread, and scallop entree. Mom had the meatballs and dad had the roasted chicken. All of the dishes were tasty and well executed, but there was nothing mind-blowing that I'd be dying to have again. The scallops were a bit of a disappointment as there was just too much going on for me - 2 or 3 different sauces, brussel sprouts, crispy kale, etc. Just too much (but each component was very good by itself). I found a hair in my pork belly steam bun and the waitress brought us out another order, but it arrived well after we had finished eating all the rest of our food (and they did not comp the dish, which surprised me). They were having issues with the lights so most of the lights were all flickering like strobe lights, and they eventually turned a lot of them off so it was very dark to eat. The manager said this has been a consistent issue, so I'm surprised it hadn't been fixed yet. Our waitress was very friendly and kind. Overall, it was a nice experience and I know I will be back. I can't say it's my favorite meal I've had, but I was impressed, especially given that On Swann has been open for a short period of time.", "date": "2016-08-08 14:56:19"}

There is no draft beer offered here with twice as man cans than bottles in the beer selection.\n\nGuacamole and fresh chips were ordered and served quickly. The chips are light and crisp for breaking up and dipping as another unique representation of the restaurant. Guacamole was \"fine\" as in we ate it, but probably wouldn't order again. \n\nWe tried a half-dozen different tacos, all of which price at $2.50 or $3.50. They were served perfectly, quickly and with ultra fresh taste.\n\nOf the six, we probably would eliminate the pork belly next time as the pork pastor satisfied that craving without the extra fat. I personally would love another handful of the other five with special mention of the chorizo, ribeye and even the duck. (You can look elsewhere here on Yelp for a review of the oyster taco. I'd rather skateboard at a Charlie Belcher live shot than eat anything involving an oyster.)\n\nThe tacos initially look small, but deliver the flavor in about 3-4 bites each because there is a good amount of protein packed in each one. \n\nThose additional sauces available are very good and deliver a nice finishing kick, although it isn't necessary with the kimchi already part of the fine ribeye version.\n\nAnd then there was the gazpacho, always a favorite of mine virtually anywhere as long as it isn't the pineapple version. \n\nBartaco's gazpacho offers a huge amount for just $5 with huge croutons already floating on top. This isn't as hearty and red as what I'm used to, but the more orange and creamy interpretation still delivered and showed another unique touch from this restaurant.\n\nI'm a huge sports fan, so I notice when any restaurant now days offers absolutely zero TVs anywhere including above the bar. It seems rare, doesn't it, and Bartaco not having any fits the atmosphere and decor perfectly. (Besides, it is summertime and there is not a primetime sporting event worth watching until college football starts on Labor Day weekend. No, the Rays games are less exciting than a blindside eviction on Big Brother and Julie Chen looks a lot better on TV than \"The Big NO,\" Mr. Destrade)\n\nBartaco has a rather odd yet effective choice of music for a place with this menu. Especially since the sound system is way above average for a dining spot. This is not nonstop Mexican music at all. As a matter of fact, it is a little bit of everything and reminded me of when I visit the wonderful Pink Taco restaurant and bar in the Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas. \n\nMy only regret, based on the quality review of fellow elite Diana A, was how we did pass on this supposedly memorable tamale.\n\nOf course, we did order almost ten different items so something was going to be left out.\n\nBesides, I was proud and rather happy with our duck choice as it ranks right up there with my other duck favorites such as Marcus Mariota and Ryan Getzlaf.", "date": "2017-07-02 04:20:56"}

I've sat in variety of locations over the years, and while they've mostly been nosebleeds, I've always had a good view of the game. \n\nSpeaking of views, the stadium was ingeniously structured with gorgeous views of Center City Philadelphia.  I have more stadium sunset pictures then I know what to do with, but I can't help taking in the sights. Slightly obstructing the city view is the high tech, digital scoreboard. Ice cream shuffle or Septa race anyone? I always look forward to the in between inning entertainment. \n\nFor a 10 year old stadium, its also pretty well maintained. Bathrooms at athletic venues normally skeeve me out, but they keep the bathrooms pretty clean. The rest of the stadium follows suit.\n\nOf course they sell overpriced stadium food and drink. However the selection and variety is actually pretty good. Last night my section was conveniently located near the Alley Brewing Company and was able to quickly get myself a Goose Island IPA. The stadium is also home to local favorites such as Federal Donuts and Chickie and Pete's. I just object to spending most of my ballpark experience waiting in line for food I can get at their flagship locations.\n\nSo I'll root, root, root for the Phillies and if they don't win its a shame....but at least I'll know that I'm going have a great time at the ball park.", "date": "2014-04-13 21:08:56"}

I convinced myself that I would definitely be disappointed because the entire existence of this place seemed too good to be true.\n\nI went with the steak sandwich and Ms. Shanna D grabbed the Club. This was the perfect storm, these two sandwiches were the top two of each of our wish-lists. That steak sandwich was serious business. I would go as far as to say it's the best I've ever had. The Club was phenomenal as well. \n\nOn the side, the roasted sweet potato rounds were the very obvious choice...and WOW. Wow. I have nothing else to say -just order these and be thankful for Yelp. What a lunch!\n\nSo a strange moment was that when we walked in, we were told that it would be a 5-10 minute wait... which didn't make a lot of sense because about 60% of the tables were unoccupied. I chalk it up to the staff still working out the kinks of a restaurant that opened a week before my two visits. This minor inconvenience was completely forgotten when our food came no more than five minutes after we put our order in. It was shockingly quick.\n\nNow one more thing: tea. I have never been a tea drinker, but Oxford may be converting me. I have had the coconut, the cherry coconut kiwi, and the banana. They were so perfect, they have me craving tea for the first time in my life!\n\nTo summarize, you absolutely must visit Oxford Exchange. Even if you are underwhelmed with the food/tea (but you won't be if you get the steak sammie), the ambiance is like NOTHING in Tampa Bay... so it's worth a trip for that alone.

However I was in fact disappointed with today's visit.  My hubs and I came here today for a day date while our daughter was at a kids birthday party.  We had a coupon for their Summer treat for members whereby club members get either 1 free bottle of wine or pitcher of sangria to enjoy at the table during a visit. I opted for the pitcher of sangria and tried the passion fruit today which OMG I would highly recommend and this will be my go-to for my monthly bottle for a while.  Not overly sweet and not very strong which is great for me since I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking. :)\n\nMade reservations for 12:45pm for lunch -- arrived and checked in right on time.  We were sort of dismissed by the hostess who told us someone would seat us soon....so we went and sat on the side bench.  2 other parties were seated before we were, which ok, perhaps they were a bit behind on seating people.  We were sat in the back corner and it was so cold that even my hubs who typically isn't cold said something and was sitting on his hands.  We were greeted by our waiter who took our drink order and let us review the menu.  He came back with our water and pitcher of sangria, took our appetizer order and said he'd be back with bread.  We sat for another good 10 minutes before we got bread and he came to take our food order.  We were busy talking and having a good time, already ate our appetizer, before we noticed that we hadn't gotten our entrees.  Other tables that sat way after us had their food and were actually wrapping things up.  Looked at my phone and it was already 2pm!!  Say what!?  Our waiter was nowhere to be seen -- then when he did appear, sped past our table to service the table behind us and never came to see us.  Received our food around 2:20pm and not once did our waiter come by to see how the food was.  A totally different person other than our waiter brought the food  and originally sat the wrong entree in front of my hubs -- he ordered the short ribs but she delivered a fish entree.  I immediately said something to her and she looked puzzled.  I had to repeat that he ordered short ribs and that surely didn't look like short ribs.  She took the entree and came back out about 3 minutes later with the food he ordered.\n\nMy Dana's Parm Chicken did not look like the picture at all -- chicken was dry and green beans & chicken were not really hot.  I think it was sitting there for some time before our meal was actually brought to us.  When we were done eating, we sat there for a long time before our waiter decided to come and ask if we needed a box.  He did pack up the food very fast and brought us our check.  This turned out to be almost a 2 hour lunch.  WOW!  Went out to the front area with the thought of stopping at the register to get my 4 bottles that I need to pick up but the line was so long that we decided to just come back another time.  The line was backed up all the way to the entrance to the restaurant!  I think every time we visit we always seem to struggle with the service here -- and one would think that since you're paying a premium for the food and dining experience that they'd do a better job with service.

Its one of the first restaurants Jose Garces worked at before he won Iron Chef, saw his own restaurant empire start to rise, gradually disintegrate, and become rebuilt in a new way.\n\nThat is one way that the Philly restaurant scene has evolved since El Vez has remained a solid constant. But another way exists directly outside of it where restauranteurs like Marcie Turney & Valerie Safran, Michael Schulson, and the restaurant group behind Zavino have developed a growing restaurant empire within the same area. Meanwhile El Vez might not even be the best Spanish influenced restaurant under Starr so long as El Rey remains an incredible spot that leads to a not that hidden cocktail bar in Rittenhouse Square, and Stephen Starr gets ready to open a new Mexican restaurant in Fishtown (https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2020/02/18/stephen-starr-fishtown-mexican-restaurant/).\n\nAll of this said above is to not so successfully summarize the reasons why El Vez often gets overlooked in today's Philly restaurant scene. I don't even think I would have come to rediscover over my past couple of visits if it weren't for spots like Charlie Was A Sinner and Sampan being so crowded when my crew set foot in them first. And really that's kind of a shame, because even though it's usually far from my first choice for bar/restaurant to hit up on the block, and its especially far from my first choice for Mexican/Spanish food in the city, the constant that it delivers does always hold up as a good one!\n\nI've covered many times over how I tend to prefer the more traditional Spanish restaurants over the more trendier TexMex varieties. But even though El Vez does appear to stand at the top of the trendy pile when you walk in and look at it, it does also tend to dish out some pretty impressive food! Favorite of mine include:\n\n\"Bazooka\" Limon Guacamole: I normally prefer my Guacamole to be the tried and true original flavor! But with goat cheese, chile flake, pistachios, and roasted tomatoes added in, this one really knows how to stand out for the better!\n\nQueso Fundido de Hongos: Otherwise a fun and more appealing way of saying cheesy fungus. But with this one having truffled wild mushrooms and huitlacoche (a more fun way of saying corn fungus which is actually pretty good) inside a melted blend of cheese, its a very fun guy fungi!\n\nTaco Arabes: Slow roasted lamb mixed with morita chiles, cucumber salsa, and lime yogurt for that refreshing win with just a tinge of spice.\n\nShort Rib Enchiladas: Served perfect and simple with chocolate mole sauce!\n\nWith a tequila list like theirs you know that El Vez does some pretty impressive flights and margaritas. But I'm not that weird in finding their Knockout Margarita with vodka to be a stand out one. But ultimately my favorite cocktails are their refreshing Guava Mojito, and their boozy bit of spicy bourbon decadence in El Viejo!\n\nWhile it may always be far from my first choice when I'm in the food centric neighborhood that is the Midtown Village Gayborhood, El Vez does always manage to have a few standout things that make me McThrilled when I do show up!", "date": "2020-03-11 05:44:13"}

Each table has its own little \"room\", which is essentially a table surrounded by roof touching rounded wood.  It is pretty private, but not what I would call a room.  It's less than a room, more than a booth.  You can choose your music for the room by pressing a button.  They have choices like Broadway, Jazz, etc., but why listen to other music when there is a live pianist playing.  We first chose pop and it seemed so out of place.\n\nWe decided to go with two different cheeses and the Taste of Bern's.  I would recommend the Taste of Bern's to everyone, because now when I go back I know exactly which dessert I want (the Macadamia cake, if you're wondering, but the banana cheese cake ranked high on my list too).  I love being able to try a variety of things.  The cheese plate was a great foil so we didn't feel like we were made out of sugar by the end.\n\nThere is no rush to the dessert room.

The stinky buns arrived about 10 minutes later, and they were toothsome indeed.  We had the beer battered shrimp bun and the pork belly with kimchi bun.  This is where the bad began though.  The server didn't notice that my drink was empty.  We waited around for another 10-15 minutes and she never bounced back over.  In fact, she was was chillin' in the corner eating with what I presumed was a friend.  The hostess, who I found out later was the owner, was loungin' at the bar having a drink with some guy.  No one to be found, my drink is empty for roughly 20 minutes and our chicken wings flew the coup.  At this point, I'm thinking 2 star at the most for the neglect. Then, like an angel from the skies of food heaven, a young lady named Erica stopped by and asked if everything was OK.  We explained everything, and she apologized 100 times over.  She brought us two more drinks, on the house, and corralled us some wings in less than 5 minutes.  The damn wings!  THE DAMN WINGS!  Fellow Yelpers, heed my word, order the damn wings.  Sweet and subtly spicy on the back end, and served with a soothing Greek cucumber yogurt dipping sauce.  THE DAMN WINGS!\n\nWe were impressed at the speed in which Erica moved things along.  We told her that she saved the day and that we would be back for the TRUFFLED TATER TOTS (because they're not on the late menu), and she would have non of that.  Eager to make up for the hiccups, she insisted on getting us some tots.  By this time, we were more curious than hungry, so we obliged.  They were 'tot-notch' too.

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the strength of the tea I had, but I will get to that.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went for Saturday brunch with 4 other couples.  For a table that large, the service was efficient and speedy.  Our waiter informed us that although they would take things out of dishes, they recommended making as few changes as possible to the dishes, because Saturday was their busiest time.  Actually, they said Thursday, Friday, and Saturday they do not make many changes to the dishes.  I appreciated this, because it meant that the food would come out in a timely manner, since they were not catering to picky eaters.\n\nI ordered the smoked salmon on an everything bagel (with fennel salad on top as well).  I could have gone with a tad less fennel salad.  It had a strong pickled flavor to it and a little goes a long way.  However, on a whole, it was absolutely delicious.  For $8.50 I felt completely satisfied.  My boyfriend got pancakes without the fruit topping and a side of bacon.  He loved it.  He talked about how much he enjoyed the pancakes the entire ride home.\n\nAs for the tea, I got the iced pomegranate blueberry green tea with honey.  It lacked flavor to me.  The tea was not very strong or very sweet.  I could have added sugar or sweetener that was at the table, but I thought the honey as a sweetener would have been enough.  The tea came first and I was initially disappointed with it.  However, after eating my meal, I enjoyed the tea more.  I think it had to do with the juxtaposition of flavors between my food and the drink.  Still, I would not buy that tea again. There was a lot more of it than I was expecting.  It came in a rather large glass.  However, I would have appreciated more flavor even if it was less tea.\n\nI don't want to give up on the tea, because I keep reading reviews about how spectacular it is.  I may have to go back to try another flavor.\n\nI appreciate that they have parking, which they share with the First Church of Christ, Scientist.  I hate parking downtown and this makes it so much more convenient to visit.\n\nUpstairs, they have a commerce club.  It is worth checking out the space, because it is pretty magnificent.  It actually reminded me slightly of the Reading Room at the University of Michigan (my Alma mater), so I felt nostalgic up there.  Apparently for a fee a month you can pay to use that space if you have a job that you can work from anywhere.  Also, as a member of the commerce club you can rent the conference rooms they have up there.\n\nAnother tidbit, apparently they will rent out space to do weddings.  They are closed on Sundays and after five on weekdays so there is plenty of time for a wedding to happen.  \n\nI definitely think this is a place you have to visit at least once if you're in Tampa.  It is almost an homage to older times where things were made to be beautiful and last instead of convenient and cheap.", "date": "2012-12-08 19:31:32"}

I can only assume that the Valentine diners the night before exhausted the staff and the wind was totally taken out of their sails. Our service was basically; \"what do you want\" and \"here it is\".

I'll just have to watch my quantities.  \n\nThe chips and salsa were a great lead in to a fantastic lunch. As many Yelpers have stated in many Mexican reviews, you can judge how the food will be by the salsa & chips and here they are top notch. \n\nWe begun our feast with Tuna Ceviche and Traditional Quesadillas. Both were excellent, I loved the Tuna and raw fish is not my thing. It totally won me over. The Quesadillas filled with Mexican truffles, wild mushrooms and Chihuahua cheese, oozed with flavor.\n\nWe then experienced the Beef Enchiladas Rojas and Street Tacos. \nOn the Street Tacos we tried the Barbacoa Beef and Cochinita Pibil. Both were good, but the Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork) would take the gold medal. It's flavors were more pleasing to the palate. \n\nThe finale was the Tres Leches Cupcake, which I will never share again. It was so good and it's sauce was one of my favorite fruits Raspberries.

I didn't originally intend to be here, or even really write a review update tonight. But when you run into Han randomly on the corner and he's incredible enough to remember you and invite you down for a beer its kind of how things set in motion!\n\nBesides I did need to revisit and do a recap of the epic ARSE 2 event that I hosted here a few weeks back. From the get go of setting things up with Han it looked like it was destined to be a tasting event of epic proportions, and it showed how much he and his crew really work with a group to meet your expectations. As for the food if your looking for fried dumplings and General Tso's hogwash, this isn't the restaurant for you. But if you're looking for a unique and spicy kick in your cuisine then get ready to climb down the rabbit hole! Also don't come if you're expecting a normal humbug restaraunteur.  Han is a crazy in the good way kind of guy who has fun with his patrons, and saves the seriousness for the spice of the epic dishes.\n\nFor our tasting we were treated omakase style to somewhere around 23 dishes (mental note get the entree list from Sam's Facebook and add it!). Among them we were wowed by dan dan noodles, green bean noodles, spicy cucumbers, amazing sausages, spicy rabbit, strange taste chicken, pork belly, pork tenderloin, soft shell crabs, and then some! hungry already? the taste of spicy peppers and chili oil made the fabled and legendary name of full name of our tasting event really realistic the next day. But such is the thing to expect when you really step it up to try some real cultural cuisine of greatness. And for that Han Dynasty always manages to be a spicy and entertaining good time!", "date": "2010-09-03 01:26:14"}

I don't think I can say anything that hasn't been said, but I'm still going to, because it was that amazing.\nSo first, let's talk about those starters. They are so plentiful, and delicious they could be a meal in themselves. There are about 6-7 little salads that are brought out to commence the feast, and each one is more delicious than the last. I especially loved the fennel salad and the carrots. Then, the bread and hummus happened. I have no words for that hummus. Simply phenomenal.  The hummus is served hot and has a smoky garlicy flavor that is just perfection. And that bread though. It is the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the delicious sauces of the numerous dishes to come in your culinary journey. \nI'm pretty sure we tried everything in this menu so I shall just extoll the virtues of some of my favorites.  The chicken pastilla is one of my favorite things I've ever tasted, ever. The sauce the little phyllo pastry was in was so exotic and flavorful, and the almonds set it off perfectly. This is a must. The haloumi was essentially a delicious hunk of exotic cheese that was toasted and served with various accoutrements. This was also perfection. Now my boyfriend's favorite was the duck hearts which he said were delicious. I have no doubt that they were, however having to gnaw my way through a pericardial sac like some sort of hyena turned me off a bit. \nFor the main courses methinks the branzino was my favorite. The skin was perfectly crispy and the sauce had a wonderful dill flavor that was just right. We also tried the kofte and cremini mushrooms which did not disappoint either. \nI was stuffed to the gills but still had to sample some of these fabulous desserts. We sampled three things, the names of which escape me now. But they were all wonderful, the pear crumble type dessert being my favorite. Everything I tasted here was simply amazing and I can't wait to get back.", "date": "2016-12-23 03:49:48"}

If you decide to read the rest of the not so good stuff, that's up to u.\n\nCome here strictly for the pie. Yes, the pie! They have banana cream, butterscotch, cookies and cream, chocolate cream, and coconut cream pie. \n\nCoconut cream pie was oh so perfect!

There were three of them that we encountered. The odd thing was that I initially wanted either inside or outside, but afterwards I told them outside because it was colder inside than outside. If I wanted outside, I should have gotten it, but that didn't happen. I might have liked this experience a little better. Inside, besides the temperature, it is extremely loud. It was to the point I couldn't talk or think. There are speakers everywhere. \n\nThe service was forever, like forever. It took a short bit of time to get seated with the No Wait app. Service after getting seated is AWFUL! Food, where do u come from, Egypt or the Orient?\n\nThe restaurant should be renamed No Biggie Biggie! I tried the cheeseburger POX. It was bland. Is there a such term as less than basic? It was that. Flimsy bread, tiny burger patty, cheese u could barely see. The POX sauce is like sloppy joe sauce from a bulk item bought at Sam's Club or Costco! The fries were unbearably salty and even tasted that way when you dip it in that POX sauce or ketchup. I had chili which lacked much flavor. Even the bottle of hot sauce I used didn't do much for it. They also need some type of crackers to go with the chili. \n\nIn anyway possible this review needed to get better.

You'll find On Swann located at the corner of W. Swann Avenue and South Oregon Avenue, a little over a block away from Cinebistro and the Hyde Park Village parking garage.\n\nExecutive Chef / Co-Owner Chris Ponte and his circle of culinary friends have created a unique contemporary American bistro where you can feel free to sample small plates of food with craft cocktails, local brews, and wines by the glass or bottle. Or if you prefer, you can order a full meal from their selection of chops, roasts, and seafood.\n\nMy very adorable Yelp friend, Anna M. and I decided to enjoy dinner at On Swann now that the restaurant has been open for a few months, as that gave them the chance to work out any kinks in their system. Anna had already snagged a table for us, and was on a first name basis with Travis, our server for the evening. She had ordered a 1796 cocktail, and so I selected a barrel-aged Walnut-Maple Old Fashioned, made with Four Roses bourbon, Bitter Truth orange, and topped with an orange peel and a bourbon-rested Amarena cherry. YUM!!!\n\nWe looked over the menu, and picked out a couple of items to share, and then turned to Travis for help with our selections. We started with a great cheese board with four of the chef's selections of soft, semi-soft, and hard cheeses. That cheese board also contained fruits, nuts, breads, and other accoutrements.\n\nNext we ordered a couple of small plate starters to share, including a tall basket of delicious pomme frites which were tossed with rosemary and sea salt, and topped with a harissa aioli. We decided that this was the grown-up version of French fries on crack, and we did our best to finish the basket. Next came a small cast-iron skillet of lamb meatballs which were served in a tomato-date sauce, over Anson mill grits with minted ricotta, and garlic.\n\nAnna and I were busy taking pictures to document our delicious meal, and that caught the eye of Executive Chef and Co-Owner, Chris Ponte. Chris came by our table, introduced himself, and checked to be sure that everything was ok. We laughed and told him that we were foodies, and really enjoying our delicious meal. He very graciously stood there and talked to us for about ten minutes, telling us about the concept of the restaurant, and giving us some behind-the-scenes information about the menu and the training that the servers receive. Before the servers work the floor they must know the details of over 175 items on the menu, and be well-versed in customer service, how the menu items are prepared, and pairing of food and drink. We told him how impressed we were with Travis as our server, as it was obvious that this guy knew his stuff. Chris thanked us, and moved around the restaurant saying Hi to other diners.\n\nMeanwhile Travis was back to clear the dishes and bring us our main entr\u00e9es. Thankfully I had ordered something light, since I was getting quite full by this point. I had seared scallops, served over a bed of pureed curried carrots, with Brussel sprouts, kale, almonds, raisins, and bacon aioli. It was a fabulous dish, but I ended up taking home about half of my meal.\n\nClearly my eyes are bigger than my stomach, as I let Anna talk me into sharing a big dish of salted caramel ice cream to finish our meal. Creamy, and oh so delicious! \n\nChris Ponte stopped back by our table to see if we enjoyed our meal, and just to chat a bit more. He pointed out Chef John Copponi who was managing his team of cooks in the open-air kitchen, and we're anxious to say Hi to John on our next visit.\n\nBottom line is that this is a superb culinary experience in a beautiful new restaurant. Be aware that the price tag matches the experience. The restaurant is busy and it can get loud. My recommendation is to go early so that you can enjoy a more-relaxed meal at this five star, bucket list facility.", "date": "2016-10-29 23:00:25"}

It is very unique.  Our waiter told us stories about the wood from the table being from St. Augustine and that everything in here has a story.  They could probably make up half the stories, but it is fun to hear and believe.  It does make you take special note of your surroundings.\n\nI love the atmosphere of this place.

People definitely come here for special occasions.\n\nI got a mojito.  It was very refreshing, but a tad too sweet for me.  However, there are so many amazing looking cocktails, that it wouldn't be hard to find another one to try.

The waiter mentioned they are very deliberate about keeping their wine prices low.\n\nWe started with the crab mac and cheese.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away.  My husband and I make our own mac and cheese from scratch so it takes a lot to wow us on that front.  \n\nI got the Deconstructed Seafood Pot Pie and my husband got the Filet Mignon.  I actually loved my choice.  It was basically a seafood chowder with puff pastry on the side.  It was chalk full of seafood.  It also came with wild rice and asparagus.  Weirdly enough, I liked the rice better the next day, cold.  I'm weird I know.  My husband enjoyed his filet.  The mashed potatoes came with popcorn in it.  It was a little strange.  I don't know what it added to it, but it was definitely memorable.

This is our favorite place to go for Valentines Day or a special occasion dinner. Great atmosphere. Recommend a reservation as it can get quite busy. My family took me here for Mother's Day and was actually the first time we've EVER had an issue for as many times as we've eaten here. I ordered the Short rib gnocchi Bolognese pasta. The dish came out and looked good despite looking like the pasta was resting in watery pasta sauce. Once I took the first bite I couldn't take anymore because my food was not warm at all. Like it had been sitting at the pass for some time. My husband ordered the Churrasco grilled steak --- same with his dish....looked appetizing but his steak was very undercooked! It was bloody and too gooey to cut. He ordered medium not rare! We waited for a little while however finally called over another waitress to help and address our food issue since our waiter (Chris) was MIA. She immediately took the dishes and said she'd let our waiter know. Like 5 minutes later Chris comes by to check on things which we explain our entree situations and he says he will check on them. Shortly after new dishes arrive by a totally different waiter. Overall my pasta was just ok --- I do have to say that as good as Coopers Hawk has been in the past, it was very disappointing to have this happen especially on Mother's Day. And I sort of lost my appetite and asked for a to go box. The manager came over and said he'd comp our drinks which was appreciated and much more than we expected. \n\nEven our go-to must have appetizer is always the Asian pork belly tostadas. The chips were a bit stale this time. But still tasteful so we ignored the fact that the chips were not very crunchy.\n\nThey have a wine room where you can schedule tastings. Highly recommend their sweet red and sparkling Raspberry wine. We are actually in their monthly wine club because of this wine. Wine club is such a great idea -- pay a monthly fee and you get a bottle of wine a month. Really supposed to be their wine of the month that you get but if you find one that you like then you can choose that bottle every month instead. Wait staff is typically friendly and fast. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu unless your food arrives cold or raw -- even the kids menu is amazing.

Lots of toppings certainly helped. I would prefer pork belly. \n\nThe ribeye was alright - not as flavorful as a carne Saad's or some other steak option. The taco was a little dry - I guess you could add toppings to fix that - but they were already a little pricey.\n\nFish taco was the better one. Solid fish and toppings. It was almost near the quality of Cali Tacos, but Cali Tacos in my past expedience is superior (it's been awhile so I could be wrong).\n\n\nThe tacos weren't bad - they just weren't that impressive either. The side of refried beans came in a tiny container - it was good, but a better portion would've been better.\n\nProbably the thing dragging down this review the most was the horchata. I'm from California and horchata is really important to me. The horchata here was syrupy and didn't have a good flavor to it. It almost tasted like powder and I started coughing after drinking it.\n\nOrder total was around $14 which isn't that cheap for tacos and a drink.\n\nOverall, Loli's is definitely not a bad place for Mexican food, but definitely not the best in Tampa.

Many moons ago, I was fortunate to have a close Brazilian friend before the masses knew anything about churrascarias with meat parades.  Back when if you wanted this type of meal, you had to hit up mom 'n pop Brazilian restaurants in seedy strip plazas.  Of them, Brasa Grill, reigned supreme.  However, once the big boys (Boizao and Texas de Brazil) moved in, the few smaller places we had closed down permanently.  Sad, actually.  It was a kin to watching the Scotty's on Gandy close because they couldn't compete with the allure and prices at Home Depot.\n\nI'm digressing, and I apologize.  I'll try to stay on track here.\n\nBottom line, Boizao was better.  I don't understand how of these two mega Brazilian steakhouses, this one was left standing.  Poor management, maybe?  Not sure.  \n\nThe meats at TDB were too salty for my liking.  It was fine for some of the medium and medium rare cuts of meat, but if you got some of the outer edges of steak, you were gonna be reaching for s glass of water after each bite.  Same goes for the chicken and pork--too damn salty.\n\nThe salad and appetizer bar had some pretty amazing goodies though.  I'll give them that.  The options were far more extensive than previous Brazilian places I've visited.  I got for the meats though, so while it was an impressive spread, it's just not my steez.\n\nThe service?  This is a tough one.  It certainly could have been better, but they had a party of 95 to contend with.  It was some local ice cream company having their annual employee appreciation meal.  At one point, a manager stopped by our table and let us know that mega party was about to start eating, and that we might experience some delays in the arrival of meats, but honestly we noticed no interruption.  As soon as we flipped our cards to green, we were bombarded.  The missed service opportunity was with our actual server not removing dirty plates and empty glasses.  Worth mentioning, but doesn't take away a star.  \n\nHad I been able to enjoy the meats without my taste buds engaged in trench warfare against the evil axis of salt, this could have easily been a 4 or 5 star review.", "date": "2017-01-09 14:16:39"}

People behind you not having to stand back. The guy in front of me was being arrested for something and it was just too close for comfort.\nOther than the hiccup I mentioned, I am always glad to see my home airport with plenty of bathrooms and amenities.  Once I disembark,  I usually head to a restroom to throw water on my face and call my ride in the cell phone lot. I grab my luggage, which is usually on the luggage mover when I arrive and step outside to a situation that is calm and not chaos.\nYes they keep the cars moving, seldom do you see a bottleneck.  Ah benches to sit if you need to wait a minute or 2 for your ride.\nYes TIA is a well organized and managed airport, one we that live here should be proud to call our own.", "date": "2013-12-14 17:39:58"}

I don't think it is a slaw that I would really eat on it's own, but in my opinion, it matters most that the slaw works with the pulled pork.  The collard greens were good, they did have some meaty flavor to them, they weren't my favorite, but they were pretty good as well.\n\nThe corn bread was moist, only a tad sweet, pretty dense.

I am now happy to say, they are being added back to both list after a very enjoyable morning. \n\nA friend who had never been to SD wanted to meet for breakfast and that is where she wanted to meet. I went with the flow, in hopes that they were back on track. We arrived early, just as they were opening and were greeted cheerfully. Two of us ordered Bloody Mary's and their spiciness was a great way to start the day. \n\nOur friend ordered, my favorite Jonathan's Famous Fiery Scramble. It's a spicy, cheesy scrambled eggs served with a choice of breakfast meat (sausage patty) and home fries. She liked it, she really liked it. Brad went with the Egg Combo Grande, a champion of breakfast. Two eggs, bacon, home fries and a short stack of buttermilk cornmeal pancakes. We also, shared a half order of Biscuits and House Made Sausage Gravy. Fluffy biscuit and a true milk gravy with huge chunks of sausage. \n\nMy breakfast was the Southwest Slinger, it was so good I'm creating a new list for slingers. It may be the only one on the list for awhile, but I am sure it will hold the #1 spot even longer.  The serving was huge, two normal people could share a single order. The plate is first covered with home fries, which are cubed roasted potatoes, covered in melted longhorn cheese, then two beef patties covered in green chilies and topped with two fried eggs.

The steaks come with onion straws, vegetables, French soup, baked potato and salad already.  But, let's say their standard salad doesn't tickle your fancy, you can get another one.  You rather have lobster bisque? Done, at a price.  All these changes are what adds on more money.  And then, of course you have to have wine.  That's when the budget is blown out of the water.  However, if you just go in for steak and the sides that come with it, you can walk out paying about $120.  That still isn't considered \"affordable\", but it sure won't break the bank either.\n\nThe steaks come with a ton of food as I mentioned earlier.  I loved the French soup.  I think that soup should always come in that little size, so I can try more.  I chose the macadamia vanilla vinaigrette and did not care for it.  It was too sweet for a salad dressing.  I tried my husband's Caesar and it was much better.  I went with the Delmonico, 8 oz, medium rare.  I first asked for very rare, but I was told that for the Delmonico I'd want to go medium rare, because the high fat content makes it chewy if it is not cooked long enough.  Fair enough.  I'm glad I took his advice, but I learned that I like rareness over fat (if that makes any sense).  Therefore, next time I'll probably go for a different cut and get it very rare.  I do love eating fat and they kept the fat on the steak for me.  The onion straws were my favorite part of the meal.  Perfectly seasoned, I'd be happy eating it every day.  The vegetable of the day ended up being carrots and green beans.  We were surprised that there were almonds in the green beans, since they didn't ask us if we had any allergies.  Luckily, my husband is allergic to pistachios, not almonds, but it was still kind of a scare.  The green beans were fantastically seasoned.\n\nI couldn't finish all the food.  Normally I would never order a soup, salad and baked potato.  I ended up taking about half home.  You won't walk out of here hungry\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of this place is very dark and it is cold.  If this was any other place, it would be considered gauche, but it just kind of works here.  I'm glad I had a scarf to wear over my dress.\n\nOur reservations were at 7:45 p.m. on a Tuesday.  We got there at 7:30 p.m. and were seating at 7:42 p.m.  No point in getting there early.  The valet is quick and efficient.\n\nWe did the kitchen tour and the wine cellar tour.  That was a one and one type thing.  I feel like I don't need to see their kitchen or wine cellar again.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal.  I do enjoy a good steak, but I still think the dessert room is what shines. (you can see my earlier review of the dessert room).", "date": "2015-11-05 14:02:18"}

Just make sure to get sambal to go along with it as you would in Kuala Lumpur.  I have never found service to be overly friendly at Penang ... but it's def competent.

Incredibly low prices for wonderful breads and pastries.  This is part of the La Teresita mega-food complex,  with the bakery now in the building that housed the original lunch counter for decades.   It is a relatively small space so they cannot offer the variety available at Florida Bakery or Alessi''s but what they do, they do exceedingly well. The bakery also has a few stools and a walk-up window for coffee or food from the next-door take-out section of the main building.\n\nThe bakery is managed by Frankie, grandson of the founders and he nearly lives there.  So drop in, have a cafe, and chat a bit it they are not too busy, then take your delectables home.   Also look over their menu/list of catering packages with several bundles of nation favorites, sweets and savories ...Cuban, Colombian, etc.   And you can order custom-decorated sheet cakes with your choice of cake flavor, filling and icing.  They did a great caketop with a set of \"Jump Wings\" for an Airborne Vets meeting, based on an image I gave the cake maker.

Yeah, it's gonna be crazy crowded for the next several weeks, but once the initial frothing-at-the-mouth-must-have-cookie-butter mania subsides we still have a pretty phenomenal marketplace located a few blocks south of Kennedy off of Dale Mabry. \n\nThe store can be found about half a block off of Dale Mabry on Swann Avenue, in a refurbished space that used to house a health club. There is a small parking lot adjacent to the store that holds about 70 vehicles, and once that's full you're on your own to find a space. Many of the enterprising neighbors are renting parking space on their front lawns for $5, or you can park in the lot at the Christ the King Catholic Church about a block away and say a few \"Hail Mary's\" as you walk back towards Trader Joe's. I would imagine that the parking issue will settle down in a few weeks, and it'll be just like any other business in south Tampa.\n\nYou'll feel the vibe as soon as you walk through the front doors at Trader Joe's. There are a lot of staff members roaming the aisles, restocking the shelves, answering questions, and helping people find various items -- and they are all laughing, joking, and having a great time. In addition to everything else, this is a FUN place to shop!\n\nDown the right side of the store is the produce section with lots of all-natural and organic fruits and vegetables. I picked up a bag of kale greens for $1.99, along with an assortment of mushrooms, leeks, and peppers before moving down to the back right corner. Today they were demo'ing how they manufacture Speculoos cookie butter which is an insanely delicious spread made from crushed cookie biscuits that tastes just like gingerbread. I forced myself to have a sample so I could report on the creamy texture to my good friend, Chris W. After one small spoonful I was saying \"OMFG!!!!!\" (which means \"Goodness but that is mighty tasty, I think I shall have another sample just to be sure\")\n\nAround the corner and along the back wall are the deli meats, cheeses, dairy, seafood and butcher cases, and after that you start weaving up and down the aisles -- just like a trip to IKEA. You'll find cereals, grains, nuts, breads, pastas, tomato sauces, salsas, chips, cleaning and health & beauty items, pet foods, a big assortment of wines, and their legendary collection of canned, boxed, and frozen entrees. Here are a few examples from today's shopping trip:\n\nTJ's brand organic marinara sauce @ $2.29\nFrozen entr\u00e9e - Indian Paneer Tikka Masala @ $2.99\nFrozen entr\u00e9e - Lamb Vindaloo @ $3.99\nFrozen fried Japanese-style vegetarian rice with tofu @ $2.99\nFrozen box of wild salmon burgers (4-count) @ $5.99\nFrozen Thai Shrimp & Vegetable Gyoza @ $4.79\n\nAdd to that their legendary Charles Shaw Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc wines (better known as Two Buck Chuck) @ $2.99 each, some natural cleaning supplies, and a few cartons of their TJ-labeled soup, and I was out the door for under $70.\n\nInsanely good prices on lots of healthy food options. Most everything carries their private Trader Joe's label, so don't expect to find the big name brands. You're not paying for brand-name advertising, and so you'll find items that are a lot less expensive. Based on a quick reading of the food labels, they have minimal hidden sugars, salts, preservatives, and other experiments-gone-wrong from your sophomore Organic Chemistry class.\n\nThe folks working the registers knew that the place was mobbed today, and they helped make the best out of an agonizing situation. One of the cashiers climbed up on a ladder and hollered out \"Hey look everyone I can see the end of the line! Wave to me if you're paying attention!!!\" and other sorts of silliness. Everyone was so gosh darned friendly that it was tough to feel frustrated even when you stood in line for so long.\n\nOne word of caution, if you're not fond of screaming children then I would suggest going in the middle of the weekday when the little bambinos are locked away in school and the aisles are cleared of double-wide strollers. Oh, and watch out for roaming food bloggers who feel the need to artfully arrange the products so they can get a better photo while rudely holding up everyone else. Grrrrrrr!!!\n\nBring lots of patience and have fun at Trader Joe's.", "date": "2014-03-23 22:05:41"}

When I first moved to St. Louis Ted Drewes was on my list of places recommended by many locals. I can understand why. This is a touristy spot and even the locals come here and wait in line for their sweet treat! \n\nI remember my first visit very well. I had no idea how to order or what to order. I was so overwhelmed with the choices. While waiting in line I was reading the menu and asking for tips on what to order;  however, instead of trying to try something different I simply asked for a M&M Concrete; it was that simple. Thank goodness! I was nervous I was going to order incorrectly. \n\nNow that I have gone back a few times I have tried their Great Pumpkin and I also tried some kind of cherry concrete with dark chocolate. Both were really good, but I'll stick with my traditional M&M concrete since it is simple and sweet. \n\nIf I ever have friends come to town I know I can take them here-I explain that the lines will be long and we just have to be patient.

From Thai Elephant to Buppha Thai to Nooddi Thai, this place seems to have bad luck.  \n\nIt just seems like we can't have nice restaurants in Delco.  Let's hope these new guys stick around for a while.  \n\nSo I ordered up some take out tonight to give them a shot.  I asked the gentlemen running the establishment a few questions.  They said the previous owners sold the place because they were running a lot of different places and having trouble keeping up with all of them.  (Translation to me meant that it wasn't making as much money as the others, but who knows?)  They also told me that they came up here from DC, and owned restaurants down there.  \n\nNow, the important part.  I got the wife and I some spring rolls (3 for $5), myself some wonton soup (a pint for $5), her some Chicken Pad Thai ($11) and me some Massaman Curry ($15).  \n\nSo let's have some fun first off.  Since the menu for the previous owners is still online, let's compare prices.  Nooddi Thai used to give you 2 spring rolls for $4.25.  They had no wonton soup on the menu, but their soups for dinner were in the $5 range.  Their Massaman Curry was $13.95.  The Pad Thai was $10.95 for chicken.  so these guys are in the ballpark for what you used to get at this place with a slight bump up in price.  Not sure how that will affect them.  But they are a little cheaper than Heng's Thai who charges the same price for their Massaman, and $16 for their Pad Thai.  \n\nTaste-wise, they did just fine.  I thought the Massaman Curry was tasty and creamy, but actually could have used just a little more kick.  The wife enjoyed her Pad Thai, and I enjoyed my tastes of it too.  The wonton soup was pretty basic stuff in my mind.  I did enjoy those spring rolls.  Just the right amount of filling.  \n\nIf I could, I'd be giving it 3.5 stars.

We were ordering drinks and food at different times, moving around to greet old friends and still everything went off with out a hick up. Our server was the best, I am so sorry I can't remember her name, because she was phenomenal. \nElla's is located in Seminole Heights on Nebraska Ave., just south of Hillsborough.  It is an old 2 story house that has artfully been refurbished into a great restaurant. They have a beautiful outside patio area, lit up with small white lights and plenty of seating, it looks so inviting. Inside it is decorated eclectic and is really quite fascinating if you take the time to explore.\nI ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, what a treat. It was seasoned superbly,  moist and almost reminded you of a steak. The bacon was well done and added a bit of different texture and taste and it was topped with tempura with chives in the batter coated onion rings, totally delicious! \nThis was accompanied by REAL garlic mashed potatoes and a medley of FRESH vegetables.  I must adress the vegetables as they were perfection! Most chains give you the frozen medley.  Here you get a bit of this and that, all fresh, all seasonal, all perfectly seasoned and cooked. The seasoning was fantastic and had the meatloaf not been so good, the veggies would have been the star of the plate.\nOthers got wedge salads of romaine that were fresh and delicious.  Pizza was a big hit with many and I heard no complaints about any food.\nOn to desserts,  here is the only mistake of the evening, besides very limited parking. I ordered the peach cobbler,  in keeping with have a great home style meal. It was served in a jelly jar warm with a small bit of ice cream. What a let down after a great meal.

Happy Happy Happy! We decided to pair our drinks with the tableside-prepared guacamole, which was a fabulous show to watch, and even more delicious to eat.\n\nI ordered the Iron Skillet Mixtos Tacos for my dinner, which was grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chicken, melted queso Chihuahua, nopales salad, avocado salsa verde, and chile de arbol salsa.

We all ordered their meatballs with mashed potatoes and loved them. Though breakfast looked very convincing for only $1.99. \n\nThe beds and couches were all very comfortable. We were trying them all out since we were so tired. The furniture looked nice as well, and some of the art pieces we saw downstairs were pretty cool.\n\nOn our way out, I saw even more food, a jumbo hot dog and drink special for $1.99 (normally what just a soda costs you), and plenty of other deals on food. The place really is enticing with its prices. \n\nMy friends are IKEA fanatics so I'm sure I will be back even though I don't have my own home to furnish, but when I get my own place I'll be sure to stop by here and see what I can find.", "date": "2009-05-07 16:46:51"}

They also have a frequent diner punch card, that rewards you for being a repeat diner. 10 punches and your 11th entree is FREE. \n\nIf I had to pick a favorite from SWD, I would be hard pressed. However, I can say my go to is their, Jonathan's Famous Fiery Scramble. It's scrambled eggs that are served; spicy and cheesy. Along with your choice of a breakfast meat, home fries and toast. Even though the home fries here are tasty and well done, I do an even swap for Calabacitas. Since I'm losing weight, a side of Zucchini is more diet friendly then potatoes. Occasionally I cheat and enjoy the home fries.  Another favorite is the Greek Omelet and I have been known to add bacon. We all know everything is better with bacon. \n\nMy favorite spot to sit is at the counter, right at the corner on the end towards the front door. \nIt's comfortable and gives me a great view for people watching. Some of the other entrees that have graced my plates at the counter are: Medio Egg Combo, Desavuno Skillet, Rocket to Bacon Land, Bat Out of Hell and my own created omelet. If you're doing lunch, you have got to do the Double Green Chile Cheeseburger. You'll think you're in diner heaven. Also, always check out specials, during the summer I loved the Fried Green Tomatoes. \n\nBefore I wrap it up, telling you that the service is always spot on and friendly.

They dine here occasionally but it's been 14 years for us. We did make reservations for 6:30 and notified the hostess of a birthday celebration. We arrived minutes before our reservation and were seated immediately in a large oversized booth. Star One earned. \n\nThe restaurant has an old world Italian decor with comfy seating, subtle, low lighting and perfect for a date night, family dinner, birthday celebration or a business meeting. The restaurant is quite large, has a nice bar area, patio seating and at least 2 large private party rooms. Maggianos can easily accomdate large groups, private events or just a romantic dinner for two. Star 2 for ambience and our big, comfortable booth.\n\nI have to admit I'm the odd man out with tonights experience and this review. I'll preference this review with the info of having dimished sense of taste lately but I do believe this didn't impact my decisions as much as others believe. But then again, maybe.\n\nOur server, who's name nor 95% of his evenings conversation did I hear, was promptly at our table for beverage orders. Drinks quickly delivered, he expected our orders next but I was the only one requiring a few more minutes. He was kind enough to take the others order and revisit my order in a few minutes. Two of the four have food allergies so they had basically one choice, Spaghetti & Meat Sauce while the other always orders the same entree, Angel Hair Lanagoisto Lobster. Pressure on, and trying to listen/visit/decide I selected the Angel Hair Primavera expecting it to be similar, if not better, to my favorite dish at Sal's Italian Restaurant. And then to my surprise, we had buy one take one of the Classic meals home for the next day. Excellent!! But again, I hadn't heard this while the server was at the opposite end of the table. \n\nThe salads and bread arrived quickly followed by the entrees minutes after the others salads were devoured. I heard nothing but rave reviews over the Lanagoisto Lobster flavors and the perfectly cooked Angel Hair Pasta, (which I debated over, damn), and how excited he was to have again tomorrow for lunch. Both the others found the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce very flavorful, nice selection of spices in the meat sauce and would definitely order again. Star three earned. The Angel Hair Primavera had large chunks of cauliflower, zucchini, carrots and squash which were crisp-tender served over a large portion of Angel Hair pasta. I felt the pasta was under seasoned and slightly overcooked. Again, this probably was no fault of Maggianos but it sure put a damper on my meal. I needed some type of crushed red peppers, quickly, and now was visually searching for our server. \n\nHe disappeared and unfortunately didn't return for some time and only after everyone else's meals were devoured. He returned with our bogo orders, which I wanted to change immediately after tasting my meal 3 minutes after he sat it down, and then he returned with our peppers. His long absence put a damper on my meal for sure but he obviously hadn't taken a breathe during his absence so I felt horrible saying anything. But you would expect a quick follow-up after dropping off our entrees, right?\n\nI put a small dent in my entree and when he returned with peppers asked if we wanted dessert. The three of us passed but expected the birthday girl would receive hers. Didn't happen and by the time he returned she had lost all interest after the heavy pasta started to settle. \n\nAll in all, everyone else enjoyed their dinner, would go again and other than the server disappearing for quite awhile, would dine here again in the near future. Star Number Four earned.\n\nAs hard as I tried not to spoil the evening, I'm sure I put a damper on the evening. All because the waiter waited 20 minutes to return from the kitchen after dropping off our entrees.", "date": "2016-09-19 23:18:53"}

I love the variety at the table- sesame chicken, a turkey sand which, char grilled eggplant sandwich and a falafel. Since I was fresh off brunch, I decided to just have some ice cream. I was intrigued by the abundance of Amish vendors so picked Miller's Twist. After sample a few flavors, I decided on a small cup of banana ice cream. Perfect!

Cocktail hour was held in the Hall of Fame section, which I was familiar with already.  The passed hors d'oeuvres and cheese boards were perfect for taking the edge off.\n\nEveryone was then instructed to take the elevators to the Diamond Club, where dinner and dancing would take place.  The fun level of this room was out of control.  A huge dancefloor was situated to the left, with high-top tables and a large bar in the back, and all the guest tables were to the right, with food stations on both sides of the room.\n\nThe newlyweds took Philly pride to a whole other level when, instead of clinking champagne glasses to initiate a kiss, guests were instead asked to wave their Phillies rally towels, which were placed at every setting.  I'm pleased to report that only one towel caught on fire and it was stomped out quickly.\n\nThe food was a highlight for many, with one side of the room offering traditional wedding fare such as pasta and chicken, and the other side of the room offering ballpark style food like hot dogs, sausage and peppers and, of course, a build your own cheesesteak station.  Always the classy one, I opted for a whiz wit, extra ketchup, and a Flying Fish which was on tap along with many other selections.\n\nAfter dinner, we danced nonstop for the remainder of the night and had a great time.

It went down smoothly. \n\nAlso tonight, I thanked my lucky stars that I do not have a peanut allergy.  As an appetizer, I enjoyed the Chicken Wing Lollipops. They were made with a Thai peanut sauce, compressed cucumber and carrot, ponzu mayo and roasted peanuts. The flavor was incredible, best way to describe it, is dipping a wing in peanut butter instead of blu cheese  or ranch dressing. They were so juicy and tender, you could suck the bones clean. Every morsel was enjoyed. \n\nMy entree was my second favorite seafood next to sea scallops and that is, Soft-Shell Crab. I've lived in Boston and traveled a lot in Florida and this by far is the best Soft-Shell Crab I have ever had.

This establishment is tucked in with  other high class restaurants, along restaurant row on Boy Scout Blvd. \nThey will not seat you until your entire party is present, so the first few of us wrangled a seat at their very tiny bar.\nLet's talk about the bar first. It is small, the bartender was obnoxious (sorry lost a star for that). One lady spilt her coke, honest accident and was not even drinking. She was totally embarrassed and the bartender had utter disdain all over his face, like it was some disaster. He was moving at a snails pace and finally accomplished the task and she got another soda & jokingly said it wouldn't happen again. The bartender turned around, looked her in the eye and rudely said it better not or you will be cleaning up your mess. I was appalled and horrified for this poor lady. Not a great first impresion. \nI watched several people that arrived after me getting served. I basically had to be almost be rude to get the bartenders attention. Once I had his slow, uncaring attention, I asked if they had a happy hour. His response was it ended at 7 PM and it was 2 till 7, so I missed it. I informed him that both he, my friend and myself knew I had been sitting their patiently for 20 minutes, 15 minutes longer than I should have, without being asked if I would like something to drink. He reluctantly poured me a glass of wine at happy hour price.\nDO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT STOP IN HERE FOR HAPPY HOUR WITH THE GANG OR YOURSELF, YOU WILL BE SONY DISAPPOINTED! \nEnter the restaurant,  nice upscale restaurant, understated furnishings and wall decor... beautiful chandelier.  The hostess explained about your meat cards green side up for meat, red side up for no meat. She was very nice and examined the set up, for those who had never been there.\nAll of a sudden you are flocked with the waiters bearing meat of beef, sausage  and chicken. It took us multiple requests to get tiny, tiny lamb chops and pork  ribs, and we never saw them again.\nThe salad bar is magnificent.  It beholds a wondrous array of beautiful food to include smoked salmon and boiled shrimp.  Behind the salad bar is a hot station, with rice, soups, etc. On the table are small rolls & mashed potatoes with no butter and a Brazilian banana dish.\nThe waiters with the meat are so fast, it is hard to get a picture of them. I think only 2 of them had a personality and appeared to like their jobs. The rest of the waiters were very abrupt, expected everyone to know which meats they needed their tongs for... I am sure they get some good tips at this establishment and would want to be a bit friendlier or fake it to try and increase their tip.\nThe place was packed. I think the gig is fill up on salad and cheaper meats quickly so you get full and forget about things like the pricier ribs and lamb. The meal comes with several fantastic dessert selections that tasted as good as they looked.\nWe had a Birthday celebration and could not find anyone to talk to about this, to see if they had something special for our birthday guest.\nI left with very mixed feelings. Most of the meat I tasted was very good and I would have again, same with the salad bar and hot station.\nI won't tolerate rude or indifference from servers, I don't care where I am dining, it is not acceptable and inexcusable in the hospitality industry. At an establishment like this I should not have to request any type of meat, let alone multiple times.  Can't say I will be returning anytime soon, really sorry to say that, but Tampa has too many great restaurants to deal with bad attitudes and inattentive service.

You have to give me so much credit for not fan girling when my visit overlapped with Mr. Vetri's visit. \n\nVisit number one in January was for brunch. I love a traditional egg-oriented brunch, but their cobb salad intrigued me. Paired with the crab bisque, I didn't miss the omelet at all. The crab bisque was rich with large pieces of crab. The salad was just large, with large pieces of everything: romaine, avocado, bacon blackened chicken and bleu cheese. I even had leftovers. \n\nDuring my second visit in January, I was finally able to try the Whiskey King. This legendary 8 ounce burger consists of maple bourbon glazed cipollini, rogue bleu cheese, Applewood bacon and foie gras. If I thought the salad was big, that's before I had the burger. I feel I needed more than a napkin to keep me clean while trying to eat this thing. I ended up cutting it in half, which caused it to fall apart a bit. Which was unfortunate. Everything was top notch quality, but it was almost too much of a king to enjoy. Maybe the trick is taking it to go and eating it in private. I wish I was able to enjoy all the fixings together, so that did ruin the experience a bit. I've heard all the hype of this burger for so long, but I can't put it on the top of my list. \n\nVillage Whisky isn't a huge spot. During visit one, we sat at the bar because there weren't any tables available.

I suppose because we were in a group, we didn't get the half price meals and appetizers everyone has raved about.

I am talking Bloggers, Yepler's, Urbanspoon foodies, not just good palates, people that love to eat and many get paid to do just that, not the right night to fumble, let alone drop the ball.\nI ordered 2 appetizers the beef carpaccio  and eggplant rollitini.\nThe beef arrived first and looked beautiful, I wanted to dig right in, but waited for some of my fellow dinners to receive their food. When I tackled the beef carpaccio it was totally void of any seasoning and the promised white truffle balsamic drizzle was no where to be seen or tasted.. A beautiful dish ruined that could have been revived with some salt and pepper and the promised drizzle. I added what I could and ate it, only because I hadn't eaten all day. My second small plate the eggplant coating was falling off, it was way overcooked and there was NO goat cheese,sundried tomatoes, basil, spinach pesto or marinara sauce.  This was truly a dismal dish, if I had not been with so many people my food would have been returned to the kitchen, along with many of my friends..\nThe person seated to my right also got 2 small plates and asked me to taste them, as he was unsure they were edible. The lamb lollipops were very overcooked, which made them rubbery and chewy and had no seasoning including the mint basil pesto,  so the dish was inedible. The second was the famous calamari which was tough and overcooked, chewy and missing the marinara.\nMy friend to my left ordered the shrimp orrichette pasta. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the pasta was beyond overcooked, soft and mushy. Across from me another shrimp orrichette pasta with no sauce, he wondered what was missing, LOL there was no sauce and even after being asked several times we never got anyone to add cheese to the dishes that were supposed to receive cheese on top.\nI also tasted a risotto that was bland, not creamy tasting at all and should have never left the kitchen. There was a burned ( I mean black spots) pizza and Bruschetta, also sorely lacking in flavor and appropriate spices. I will just mention one last dish in this dismal review the crispy duck whose skin was not even brown, let alone crispy and it was missing the vanilla and dried cherry Chianti sauce.\nI can only imagine what caused all of these problems and a host of others: lack of kitchen staff, no one to expedite the orders, sauce chef out to lunch, lack of leadership in the kitchen, help me out here I am grasping. There is no excuse for food like this to leave the kitchen of any caliber restaurant....NONE.\nThe reviews I read, my friends and peers recommended Bernini's and I respect their opinions and know they had good food and dining experiences.\nAs the saying goes in the world of food, you are only remembered for your last bad dish.\nWhat's a girl to do? I tried to make excuses, until it became clear, there was NO excuse to serve inedible food and plates missing key components, so I made no more excuses.", "date": "2014-02-16 04:32:43"}

We also ordered some chili and some mac and cheese. We basically split the meals so that we had lunch on Sunday and lunch on Monday with the food we ordered. Both of our meals were good, but we both agree that they aren't anything special. I honestly don't know if I would ever crave a meal from Jilly's. A cupcake? Yes. But not a meal. The cafe menu is just A-Ok. \n\nI think the main treat for us were the cupcakes! We split the Crown Candy Apply cupcake and the Jack and Coke cupcake; they each had a shot in them...but I am not sure if the cupcakes themselves were actually made with any liquor?

There is no way I could eat a whole cupcake or even half a cupcake in one sitting. I definitely recommend splitting them into 4 slices and taking 2-3 days to enjoy the bites. \n\nWill I go back to the cafe for a lunch or dinner? Probably not.

Mission accomplished!\n\nThen we enjoyed our very affordable and properly prepared breakfasts. Nobody ordered pancakes but we dared one particularly bold member of our party to take a picture of a huge pancake at someone else's table. No problem! \n\nWe were stuffed at the end so we all ordered pie to go! I can't wait to try it tonight!", "date": "2016-08-23 15:42:50"}

Because the Greek salad was worth an update.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI visited Hellas several years ago and have always had it on my list to return. I originally rated it 3-stars due to a very average gyro, but I know that Hellas is a treasured staple of Tampa Bay and Tarpon Springs, so I wanted to give them a second chance. I don't live anywhere near Tarpon Springs though, so it took me a while to make my return visit.\n\nI had been craving a greek salad and the Hellas version of that absolutely did not disappoint. I'd recently settled for a Greek salad from a fast casual spot near my house and it was a \"you get what you pay for\" situation. But the Hellas Greek salad hit the spot for everything I wanted it to be. \n\nHowever, I stand by my 5+ year old rating of the gyro. My wife opted for one and it was as pedestrian as I remembered it to be. In addition, I asked for a side of gyro meat for my salad, and it was barely room temperature, which was a bit off-putting.\n\nWe also hit up the bakery afterward, where I scored a Mil'fe and a Coconut Pasta, which is basically just a Coconut pie/custard concoction. Both were just ok. I also had a Greek coffee, which was a shot of espresso with sugar, but they leave the grounds at the bottom of the cup. They're compacted so it's not like you're tasting ground coffee bits throughout. It was pretty tasty, actually!\n\nOne shoutout I wanted to give is to our server. I screwed up by not getting her name, but she was amazing, despite Hellas very crowded and loud. I commended her ability to act like we were the only customers in the restaurant.\n\nSo to sum it all up...\n\nGreek Salad: 5-stars.\nGryo: 3-stars.\nBaked Goods: 3-stars.\nService: 5-stars.\n\nA round 4-star average!", "date": "2019-05-01 14:38:28"}

One time is by my own and many time are power dinner with the clients. Since then, I have not been back for about five years. Since then, they value of the meal has changed to better. Before it, the side is paid as a la carte. Now they include as part of the meal. It make the value of the dinning improve. \n\nWe were seated at the Bronze Room. I like open room with bronze statues on the wall. It is elegantly decorated. We order the 14 oz chateaubriand for two and a chop steak. Each meal come with onion soup, salad with dressing of your choice, fried onions, zucchini and carrot. The French onion soup is amazing. \n\nMy steak was perfectly grilled. I would said if you come here, chateaubriand is the way to order your steak. No other place do better than here. The chop steak is well presented over the mash potatoes. I like the waiter prepare the whole potato to added all ingredients on it including the bacon bite. \n\nAfter the dinner, it was a pleasure to visit their kitchen and the cellar. I saw many famous post of pictures are in this cellar. The dessert room is like a maze. We have the taste of the Bern with five Bern's signature desserts. I like the King Midas and the banana cheese pie. \n\nEverything is good here.

It seriously looked like the color of blood to me.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese and I honestly felt like it could use more truffle.  It was good, but I was expecting better.

We were seated and presented with a bowl of spicy chilli peanuts with cilantro... So yummy!

They were delish and only served on the rocks, no frozen ones here). \n\nI wasn't too hungry which was great because this is a small plates place. I had a fabulous soup, possibly one of the best soups I've ever had. It was sugared pumpkin and was offered with lump crab and roasted crushed walnuts on top! It was amazing!! Different and I would never think to put those ingredients together, but it really worked! Then I had the Mexican city style quesadilla filled with mushrooms and pure yumminess! Don't think big cheese quesadilla this was small and more like a tostada, but really enough food and really tasty. They do have some great vegetarian options!! My second choice would have been the grilled cactus, black bean, crispy quinoa and salsa tacos. \n\nMy husband had a pot of refried beans and the skirt steak tacos which came 3 to a plate and were smaller, but he still wound up taking one home. \n\nCompared to those around us, we barely ate! The plates just kept coming for everyone! The salads, flatbreads and veggie nachos looked great too! Everything looked so interesting! Everything on the dessert menu looked good too! We were tempted by the flan with caramel, gala apples, toasted hazelnut with roasted apple sorbet, but we went with the classic churros to keep it traditional. They were so perfect soft, hot, and sugary! They came with two dipping sauces and were so moist I kept checking to see if there was cream inside. Yum! \n\nThe waiters were very much in a rush and the hostesses weren't super friendly, but the food made up for it and the music was real good! \n\nStreet parking was fabulously easy! Tons of spots, tons!  \n\nIt was a very mixed crowd... Older couples, college kids, even families, but mostly groups of young professionals. \n\nWe intend on going back and will even bring our two year old to sit and eat in car which looked so fun! \n\nA really great time was had!

Well played.\n\nThere were 4 of us with reservations for 7.  My broski and his wife are the prompt ones in the family, so they were there at 6:45 and seated 4 minutes later.  By the time me and la chica arrived, not only did we find them seated, but they had already defiled an entire loaf of pretzel bread.  So we sat down, asked for some more bread and ordered up some wines to sample.  Chardonnay for me and the sparkling wine flight for chica.  She prefers reds, so I'm not sure what she was thinking.  At this point, an ordering gaffe when dining out is almost obligatory for her at this point.  She liked 1 of the 4, which was the ALMOND SPARKLING.  I liked my CHARDONNAY, but it wasn't the best I'd ever had.  Still, no gripes from me.\n\nAfter the wine came, we placed our appetizer orders: PORK BELLY NACHOS and AHI.  Both came out super quick, 5 minutes maybe.  The ahi was OK, IMHO.  I certainly wasn't wowed. However, I was wowed by those nachos.  Jesusfreakingchrist they were descrumptious.  So cheesy and meaty, and the little pieces of dices avocado were perfect on top.  If they weren't so expensive, I probably would've ordered two and called it a day.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA because saltimbocca it's becoming my favorite Italian cooking style.  It literally means \"jumps in the mouth,\" and is usually made with veal, so I was surprised AND excited to see a chicken variation on the menu. It  didn't come with a salad, so I requested a CAESAR, which came out almost as fast as it was ordered.  This was a full blown dinner salad though, not a side salad, so I shared it with chica.  I loved that it was a chopped salad, and loved the thick shards of parmesan cheese, but the dressing was unremarkable.  Not sure what we paid for the salad, but I'm certain it was too much.  As for the main dish, it was really good.  There were 3 chicken breasts of moderate size, served in saltimbocca sauce with capers, provolone and prosciutto on a bed of fresh asparagus with mashed potatoes.  It was good and plenty for sure.  There was an odd tartness to the sauce flavor that I couldn't put my finger on though.  Not sure what it was.  Either way, it was better than the saltimbocca at Zerillo's, but not better than Fratelli's in Oldsmar, so I have to give it a 3.    \n\nGreat service + tasty wine + fair prices + slightly above average food = I would return if asked, but probably not on my own accord.\n\nSide note: Parking is tight because there are 3 restaurants competing for spaces, so if you plan to avoid the valet service and park yourself, be prepared to get a little flustered.", "date": "2013-05-05 13:46:25"}

Unfortunately, due to the size of the space, it's a little hit or miss to get a table. Bufad is down the street if you don't mind forgoing the bar for a BYOB. \n\n4) When it's crowded, it's crowded.

It's decor is all early 20th Century post industrial.  This has it's charm with high ceilings and exposed pipes and ducts, and large photos of the local buildings in black and white that are strong suggestions of it's history. \n\nOn Saturday morning it was packed with a 20 something crowd enjoying Rival Bros Coffee and a short, but tasty breakfast/lunch menu. Hard walls make for poor acoustics, and the din was several decibels above comfortable. But, everyone was friendly and dealing with the racket. Even the queue to the single restroom had cool people who understood the situation and willingly chatted with their line mates.\n\nOur table wait was about 25 minutes, but we made it to a small deuce in the middle of the room, with people on either side. It was tight, but the ambient noise allowed for privacy. The menu was divided into brekkie and lunch on either side of the document. I went with the chicken salad wrap, and DT opted for their burger. Both we're good. The burger seemed hand packed which gave it a softer texture and more retained juices. I prefer a more chunky chicken salad, but had no negs about theirs. We were drinking the house java, which was hot and kicky, but served in small white cups that needed refilling after a couple of gulps. Larger joe vessels would have been more efficient for the staff and felt more generous to the customers. \n\nCafe Lift is a very interesting place to hang out. The room is really humming and the staff works hard to please. The harshness of the sound makes the experience not completely ideal, but that is overcome by the quality of the people and the kitchen, not to mention the enjoyment of just being in an old urban factory that has been so well repurposed.", "date": "2017-04-05 14:30:18"}

It was odd to me that investors in the 90's skipped right over downtown's suburb and went right for Seminole Heights.  Now, it seems the tables are turning and maybe, JUST MAYBE some revitalization will come to this forgotten part of town.  So far, we're off to a good start.  First, there was the purchase of the old Rialto Theater.  Then came the building of Waterworks Park, and now we've got Ulele.  I like where this is going!\n\nOn my first visit, 6 of us rolled up on Ulele on a warm and rainy September Sunday night as part of an ad-hoc pun and food crawl.  The wait time for us was about 20 minutes, so we bellied up to the bar and ordered some beers and cocktails.  I naturally had an old fashioned.  Only one though because the bartender was heavy-handed on the pour, which is definitely not a problem.  We all became familiar with the menu while sitting at the bar, so we were ready to order as soon as we were seated.  First, I ordered up some jalapeno muffins since they do not offer any complimentary bread. For my meal, I summoned the PORK CHOP with mashed potatoes and got the Ulele side salad.  Not everyone can successfully cook a thick-ass pork chop, but I saw them cooking a few of them on the grill, so I had to give it a whirl.  Glad I did too.  Not only did it look great with its cris-cross grill marks, but it tasted fantastic.  The mashed potatoes were decent, but nothing to write home about.  They were, however, better than the collard green and lima bean mixture.  The side salad was equally as delicious.  Not sure what all of the greens were, but I'm certain there wasn't any actual lettuce in there.  Definitely worth a try.  \n\nOn a return visit, I discovered my favorite Ulele dish: Pompano with rice and fried carrot shavings!  I know it's difficult to order fish with the smell of grilled steaks and chops looming thick in the air, but trust me, the pompano is better than their land animals.\n\nStaff is always ultra friendly and the decor visually stimulating and the outdoor area next to the park is a pure paradise.", "date": "2014-09-29 17:11:46"}

C'mmandahs (in my best approximation of the regional dialect) is the standard bearer for food, service, environment, and an overall dining experience. It simply doesn't get any better.\n\nI first came to Commander's the day I was sworn into the Bar. I was living in the Lower Garden District, working as an associate for the biggest law firm in the state and my parents had planned a visit to town (without knowing about the Bar ceremony). I kept things quiet because I didn't want to face the potential humiliation of my parents facing my failure but Praise Be, I passed. I was sworn in. My parents saw. We ate at Commander's to celebrate and lounged about the rest of the day, not talking or eating so as to fully concentrate on what we'd experienced. I was younger and, largely, inexperienced in the world of finer, experiential dining. The experience, while grand and extremely memorable, was somewhat lost on me.\n\nFast forward years later. Back in New Orleans. More traveled. More experienced. More ready for the night I had before me. I was ready to take the full Commander's experience in as a cognizant adult. This was my time. I donned my coat (it's nice to dress up to go to dinner), bow tie (apropos of the occasion) and glasses (form AND function) and made my way to the gem of the Crescent City. Walking in, we were immediately greeted (warmly) and walked throughout the building to a private dining room on the second floor. \n\nIncredible.\n\nThe room was ornate without being gaudy... done up without being off-putting... perfect. The lighting made everyone look like models. The chandelier glistened, sparkled and set the mood for dinner. Before I could take it all in, our service team entered the room, lead by Lorenzo. You don't know service until you have dined in some of the nicer (older) New Orleans restaurants. Galatoire's, Antoine's, Arnaud's... they all know how to make you feel special. Yes, there are newer. Yes there are shinier. Yes, there are more expensive. But none match that the stature and legacy of the old guard. You might not remember every dish but you'll always remember how you were made to feel. Lorenzo made me/us feel like royalty. From the stories to the descriptions of the plates to the suggestions to the coordinated service... I was swept off my seated feet. With every course made into a tasteful spectacle and every beat choreographed to perfection, it's hard not to be smitten with the dance.\n\nIf top-notch service doesn't press your buzzer, the food/drink should definitely ring your bell. As with most meals, I started with a cocktail. The Sunset on the Patio was a seasonal offering I was quick to try despite the base spirit (I am a rum/bourbon man). The drink was an attractive mix of El  Jimador  Reposado tequila, lime, Mandarin  Napole, and finished with pomegranate grenadine. Patio on Sunset. I paired this with too much bread (can't be helped; so soft, fresh and delicious with the butter) and the crawfish bisque. Exquisite. No more description is needed. Sparking wine bridged the gap between starter and entree -- which was paired with red wine. Keep up. My Gulf shrimp risotto was a decadent specialty item and a savory masterpiece. Even though the tastes didn't necessarily go together, I couldn't help not eating some of the goat cheese thyme grits that were being shared. The calories were worth the decadence. Since I was going all in, I finished up with strawberry shortcake and port wine.... and a cappuccino. \n\nI didn't want to get up from the table. A meal like this should be savored... drawn out for as long as possible. The evening ended with a quick tour of the property and - just like that - we were back into the sticky, sweet pecan-crusted air of the Garden District. With my belly full, clothes tight and brow sweaty, I felt like Big Daddy. I didn't want to leave. Commander's made me fall in love again with the New Orleans I left behind over a decade ago and long before that damn storm. Without question, it's as good as it gets.", "date": "2016-08-04 17:55:40"}

My sister thought they were a bit bland, but she had removed the jalapenos from hers. *****5/5\n\nTruffled Tator Tots: I'm not a fan of mushrooms or truffle oil so I did not indulge in the tots, but my husband and sister thought they were great. *****5/5\n\nChinese BBQ Pork Stinky Bunz: They were good, but next time I'd try the pork belly instead. ***3/5  \n\nSpicy Beef Tartare: The diced apples on beef was a different approach, but I didn't love the flavors or textures in this dish. The wonton chips served with this dish were super bland and overcooked. **2/5\n\nSpicy Tuna Tartare: This appetizer was horrible!!!  The dish had a very off taste.  I don't know if the tuna was soaking in something to help prevent the fish from oxidizing, but the tuna did not taste fresh and we only ate a few bites before pushing it to the side. If Anise cannot turn over tuna quickly enough they should really consider removing this item from the menu because nobody wants to eat old tuna. This dish was served with the same bland, overcooked wonton chips.  0/5\n\nI'm on the fence if I'd return to Anise Global Gastrobar.  Overall, the food did not impress me so maybe I'd just stop by happy hour to grab a few cocktails.", "date": "2014-02-10 18:42:15"}

I've been trying to eat this food since our CM told me about these guys a few years back.  Unfortunately, the only time I was in the Winter Park area was a Sunday and they were closed.  But now they're just a few miles from home with their new Carrollwood location.\n\nUpon walking in, this place is impressive.  It's vast, and very well-equipped for some high volume traffic.  The ordering process is a kin to a cafeteria line, which works surprisingly well for this type of food.  Why sit down and wait for food that is already prepared?  So they get props on a speedy an efficiency setup.\n\nWhere they fell short was with the taste of the food.  I ordered burnt ends and some Texas sausage.  For sides, I ordered some beans and potato salad.  Of these 4 items, the sausage was by far the best.  It was slammin', actually.  The burnt ends, however, were misleading, and the flavor was just okay.  Misleading, you ask?  How so?  Not sure how to explain this, but I will try.  When I've ordered burnt ends in the past, all I got was burnt ends.  The top charred portion of the brisket from being slow smoked.  What 4 Rivers served me ($6.99 for a 1/2 lb.) was a few scattered burnt ends mixed up with a bunch of shredded brisket.  I counted 5 burnt ends amongst my shredded brisket.  F.I.V.E.  Not a half pound. Very disappointing.  As for the sides, the potato salad was damn good, but the beans were just meh.  There was also a hiccup with La Chica's order, but that's for her to type up and tell.  Either way, it took from my experience because she had to sit there and watch me eat my food.\n\nWhat I did like though is that there is a hand washing station next to the trash bins.  Nice warm running water, soap and hand towels, so no need to hit up the restroom before leaving.  Just dump your trash, wash your hands and hit the road!\n\nWould I go back?  Not sure.

This happened to be the place inside and out.\n\nOutside consisted of a huge wrap-around patio with a great amount of tables to sit at, as well as a lounge area, just to talk with friends. \n\nThere were pretty cool metal decorations that you would probably find at an art fair, farmers market, or art show that proved that be quite original like mariachi metal bands, & different types of human like figures. There was shade and sun and a cover to protect from rain if needed. It was also a pet friendly environment which fit in with the homey comfy feel of the place.\n\nElla's doesn't accept call ahead seating until about 12:45pm for parties of 8 or more. Brunch starts at 11, and people start lining up around 10:30am ish. These people wait forever. It's that good.  They just drink & socialize to pass the time. They have great flavored mimosas including guava, mango, watermelon to name a few & a full bar.  \n\nAfter they had waited for a while, we finally got a perfect outside table on the patio.\n\nWe had an awesome waiter who helped us with our options. I ordered side of shrimp & grits w/ chicken & waffles. My hubby had a rib combo w brisket, ribs, & fried green tomatoes. Our friends ordered bacon, mac & cheese, nutella, banana waffle, HUGE biscuits & gravy w chorizo, & chicken and waffles with fried green tomatoes.  We all tried everything and seriously everything was good, and was rich from lots of flavor. It definitely hit the spot.\n\nWe hung out there for a bit. Took our time since I had a large mimosa ($10). It made for a perfect brunch. I look forward to trying their dinner sometime & as well as their live music.", "date": "2014-12-11 01:42:34"}

Ok, fussy baby, singular, my friend's baby was a perfect angel laying in his stroller for most of the meal. Mine had to be walked around the outdoor area by one parent for almost the entire time.

The cheese is baked to a crisp on the crust and the sauce is deliciously sweet. The Ahi Tuna Salad is delicious as well. It probably isn't the healthiest salad in the world with the heaping of fried won ton strips, but you only live once and I still felt healthy(ish) eating it. \n\nService was definitely slow.

At this point you have waited almost thirty minutes for a mediocre meal that you paid too much for that was served to you on a tray with no waiter service. To make matters worse you realize that you have finished your beverage while waiting for your food so you just have to eat your food on a dirty table with no beverage!\n\nI'm not sure what the deal with the parking is. On our first visit we parked in the lot for free, but our second visit we had to pay $5 to park and were given a voucher to get $5 off at any purchase at Armature Works. What is the point of paying to park if you're going to immediately be reimbursed?!

The food is a wonderful blend of Spanish and Cuban with terrific table-side prepartaion for many of the items.\n\nThe Columbia is located in the historic Ybor City section of Tampa, just north and east of the port and the Channelside districts. The restaurant takes up the entire block at 7th Avenue between 21st and 22nd Streets. You can't miss the big white building covered with decorative Spanish tiled artwork on the outside.\n\nInside, the restaurant is a mixture of smaller dining areas, ranging from the lovely garden room with it's central fountain, the wine cellar room where the nightly flamenco dancing show is held, the bar area with its huge hand-carved wooden bar, and then numerous private dining areas for smaller groups.\n\nIf I'm there for lunch, I enjoy their famous 1905 salad which is mixed up table-side (Iceberg lettuce with julienne of baked ham, Swiss cheese, tomato, olives, grated Romano cheese and their famous garlic dressing) with a cup of thier Spanish bean soup (garbanzo beans simmered with smoked ham, chorizo sausage and potatoes in a chicken broth). Oh, and let's not forget the warm Cuban bread, served as small, individual loafs for each diner and piping hot.\n\nFor dinner, I always take a date and some friends so that we can sample a variety of choices off the menu. We'll usually start with a pitcher of homemade Sangria (red or white), and then follow that with 1905 salads, and our choices of entrees. Over the years I've tried many selections, and never been disappointed. My personal favorites are the Snapper Alicante, the Mahi Mahi \"Cayo Hueso\", the Filet Mignon \"Chacho\", and their wonderful Paella.\n\nA great place for your out-of-town guests, and a fun night out with a date or a business client.", "date": "2012-08-05 03:13:40"}

Everything flowed perfectly with the old school, moody vibe.  \n\nWe sat down at the bar and asked if the kitchen was still open.

There were no ifs, ands or buts, and no offers to see if there was anything that could be done.  For a new bar trying to make it in a recession, I found this response to be pretty off-putting.

She also did not break stride when I handed her my $20 CL Deal and applied it to my order faster than any other time I've ever used one at any local business. (You know and I know some employees HATE these things, which is too bad because they almost always bring in a new customer.)\n\nDidn't realize how far $20 goes in a place like this, so I took home quite a few things.\n\nThe highlight for me was clearly their hot melt called The Sound of Music and I added turkey with the other ingredients for a modest extra two dollars. On the first bite, I realized what I had created. Anyone else remember that glorious hot Turkey O'Toole served on the pretzel bun at Bennigan's? \n\nHonestly, everything I walked out of there with was quite good. With no sweet tooth, even I broke down and had a single buckeye, which speaks to my Ohio roots and is very tough to find around here. (No, I did not attend Ohio State and I root against them every Saturday as long as Urban Liar is head coach.)\n\nI really appreciated the creativity and selection of all their sandwich offerings (including all the cheap ways to add/customize as I did with my Sound of Music/Turkey O'Toole) and the colorful presentation of all the different donuts, cupcakes and other treats. Some sandwiches are on display and clearly made in advance, which is why a little customization always gets you something made fresh. \n\nOccasionally, we all have those days when we need a box of sweet treats to make an impression on a group of people. Dough will be my destination the next time I need to do this and I'll grab my old school Bennigan's sandwich again to see if it rings true one more time.", "date": "2014-11-12 18:25:48"}

It's almost impossible to beat.  Okay, I will admit that the special rolls are definitely pricier but they are worth the cost.  Between my own orders over the years and my incessant \"mooching\" off of everyone else's plates, I've tried a pretty wide range of the menu and have yet to be even mildly disappointed.  \n\nThe quality of the rolls is almost Bluefin-level and the variety is amazing.  I love the birthday roll, which is filled with plenty of albacore, salmon, tuna, oshinko (love that crunch!), avocado, and cucumber, wrapped in soy paper, and topped with masago; it's a delcious combination and soy paper is a perfect foil for the crunchy oshinko.  The ocean brother roll is another fav with shrimp tempura, avocado, wasabi, and actual lump crabmeat, not \"krab.\"  In terms of regular rolls, I would definitely try a white tuna/eel/spicy salmon trio.  It's fail-proof.  And don't leave without getting the tuna dumpling!  It's a \"purse\" made out of thinly sliced, fresh tuna wrapped around a filling of avocado and roe, and served on top of a checkerboard of sauce, and is a staple here.  Kinda like how the tuna sundae is a staple at Bluefin.  It even looks absolutely darling, like two little red lanterns.  The actual sushi here is fresh and tasty but the rolls are definitely their forte.  The fish, while good, didn't really stand out from that at the other surrounding sushi restaurants.\n\nThe party platters here are also pretty good and a medium will easily feed a family of 3-4 for under $60, which is fantastic considering the fact that they give you a good selection of sushi (salmon, eel, albacore, tuna, yellowtail) along with spicy tuna, salmon, red dragon, alaska, and california rolls.  Most other places usually just give you california rolls in the platters.  It was less than $60 for that and an order of the dumplings.  Plus, everything was ready when we went to pick up our food.  No wait time = happy dad (and me...and the rest of the family). \n\nThe restaurant (not exactly a sit-down place) is tiny and seating simultaneously sparse and cramped, but bolsters a fun, relaxed atmosphere if you only have a small party (3 or less people).  Grab a seat at the bar, if there is room, and have fun chatting with the chefs while nomming on your rolls.", "date": "2012-06-29 04:01:22"}

I ventured to my favorite spot for oysters though early in the season for a friends birthday party. I was interested in the oyster special happy hour which is 75 cents not 50 cents as it used to be and that was a sign of worse to come. We ordered bowls of gumbo that is excellent but has gone from $8 to $10 per bowl since I have last been here. They used to have daily specials where you order get an entree and a cup of soup for about $20 and that is gone. The menu has been reduced a bunch of high priced items that you would have expected from August or any of his other places that you didn't get here. Luke was like a neighborhood kitchen that served really good food at a good price but now he has gone for the tourists instead of the locals and it shows in more ways than one. They have added more tables and crammed the small interior, the tables are now so small you really can't fit the oyster trays on them comfortably when seating a table of 3 or 4. The oysters themselves were the worst I have ever had from them with about 3 that were not opened that I had to open at the table. Gumbos normally come with hot french bread and they only brought one for a table of three where they are supposed to be given to each person not per table. The oysters have really turned into a lost leader to get you in the door and spend a check that you really were not anticipating. They have baked oyster not char broiled at a whopping $17.50 per half dozen. My friend though it was for a dozen and ordered the half not knowing the $17.50 was for the half dozen which made the situation even worse. To top it all off we were there for a birthday and notified the hostess and the waiter and there was no recognition with a dessert or not even a happy birthday from the waiter. From start to finish this was a miserable experience and one that I was not expecting from a John Besh restaurant and is not qualified as a TOURIST TRAP.

I have built so many IKEA objects I could be an assembler for them. Once you get used to their \"directions\" it's a breeze. Love the engineering and that you can put almost every item together without power tools. \n\nOnly 4 stars because on our initial visit we signed up for their orange loyalty family card. It emailed us a coupon. We proceeded to spend the next 6 hours walking through their store. We purchased over $1200 worth of items. We went to use our coupon on the email, clicked the link, and it said it had already been used. ??? Ok, so we told them we definitely want to use the coupon and so we would like them to call a manager to make this happen. Manager came over, proceeded to try and tell us how to work our phone and get to the coupon, to not avail..... Manager went to the office and called the staff back and said 'this one time we will make an exception and for her to use another customers coupon. There is no way for me to override the coupon and enter it in as $25 off.' Hmmm, I am not sure I believe that but whatever. She scanned another customers coupon and gave us the discount. It was super frustrating having to do this to staff. It was an IKEA coupon, that THEY sent us via email when we signed up for THEIR card. We could not have printed it off as we have been in THEIR store for the last 6 hours. Ugh. We hated holding the line up and we hated being 'those people' but dang it, if you send us a coupon for $25 at least let us use it! \n\nSo, we left and got home and proceeded to put together several shelving units and such. All went together smoothly and without issue. One of the shelving units (yellow one) was built slightly differently even though it was the same unit. Maybe a different manufacturing place or maybe it was a different assembly line since it was an unusual color? No idea but it was a bearcat to assemble compared to the other ones we bought which were black/white, green and gray/blue. When I slid the pegs in it managed to crack the surface causing the yellow coloring to come off. Frustrating. \n\nOther than that I noticed how the directions have gotten better since the last time I assembled these items (10 years ago.) And some of the items they have had long term (12 years old) are now made much better and are much more sturdy. I love that they continue to improve their items even though their old items still 'worked.' Well done IKEA. \n\nThank you for keeping your prices reasonable. Thank you for thinking 'outside of the box' on a lot of your items. Thank you for NOT being Amazon and packaging your items smartly. \n\nWe have since this visit been back once. We intend on returning yet again for our bathroom components. I have honestly thought about applying at your stores as I love your items, love your stores (clean), love your food and love the concept of well engineered items that are not over priced. Plus+ I can assemble everything we have bought thus far all on my own without using ONE power tool. \n\nOh, one more downer... why do you send items out without mounting screws such as the toilet paper holders and the magnetic knife holders? I am stuck with them sitting on my counter because every single screw I have at my home is black and does not match the silver of the items. \n\nNo matter, I still love IKEA.

It looked so different. My take was it was a graham cracker crust . . . a very substantial graham cracker crust. This was confirmed by our server. The chocolate part was rich-looking, thick and dark. There was no way I could try that. One little taste would have put me in a sugar coma. But it would be a good dessert to share among a table of 5 or 6.\n\nService was fabulous. Water and Diet Pepsi were refilled before they were gone and without my having to ask.\n\nThere were so many down-to-Earth offerings that sounded delicious, substantial and filling! No fluff stuff here!!\n\nIt wasn't too crowded, but we began at 1 p.m., so perhaps we were after the lunch crowd.\n\nI didn't look around too much, but the atmosphere was comfortable and inviting.

Some places can text you when your food is done like Chismis and Ichikoro.\n\nI'm a fan now and I'm glad it's here in Tampa!

Because what's not to like?\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nSo I am not big on reviewing chains, but IKEA is near and dear to my heart. Just about my entire house is made up of so many IKEA furnishings, I feel the only thing left would be for my hair to turn blonde. IKEA has great style, unbelievable selection and is practically big enough to be its own zip code. Every time I try out the competition, I always come away realizing it was stupid to even attempt it. IKEA is and always will be #1 and there's no close second.\n\nI consider myself to be pretty stupid when it comes to putting things together, assembling things, or working with tools in general. But despite many IKEA purchases, I've never screwed up the building process of any furniture item. I may have realized an error and had to back track five-steps to correct it, but I've never had anything fall apart on me. As for the inconvenience of having to build your own furniture, I usually just use that time to catch up on my highly neglected DVR. I also find it very rewarding once I finish up, which is probably because, like I referenced before - I am a monkey when it comes to putting things together.\n\nI used to complain about how they only have self check-out registers open, but the last couple of times I've gone, that has not been the case. I also used to bitch about the fact that you had to buy bags, but after picking up a few...those bags are about the best investment I've ever made. I use them all the time... I feel like they could support about 500 pounds of weight in each one.\n\nThank you IKEA for building one of your amazing facilities in Ybor, if the nearest location was still in Orlando, I don't know what I would do with myself.", "date": "2012-07-01 03:24:37"}

It's almost embarrassing to watch us fight over every last tidbit.  Next is often a salad.  Every time it's a delicious blend of fruits or vegetables and a unique dressing.

They actually have some affordable wines by the glass which I found interesting. Of course my hot date didn't order those..\n\nThen we did dessert room. Fun and intimate. Dated and classy old school. Broadway music piano playing. Never got to use phone or make requests but we heard Memories from Cats, Phantom of the Opera, \"I'll do it my way\", and other hits from Boon's Broadway era.\n\nWe did two dessert samplers.

By noon when we got the sandwiches it was turning into elbow people to get through territory. I can't even imagine what this would be like on a weekend! \n\nFirst of all, the deli section is CHEAP. My friend got some sides and I thought they were $11 for a small container, I misread it, they were a little over ONE dollar. Mind. blown. The sandwiches were $6 each. Anywhere else it would be over $10. Five stars for the price. \n\nI tried four sandwiches, the Caprese, the Reuben, the Philly, and the Meatball. My ranking is I liked the Caprese best, then the Philly, the Reuben and then the Meatball. My dad liked the Reuben, the Philly, the Caprese, then the Meatball. We both liked the Meatball so that tells you how spectacular the other sandwiches were. This also shows you that each person will have their particular tastes, but all the sandwiches are spectacular. \n\nI loved the Caprese because the mozzarella was so dang fresh. I wish I bought balls of it to bring home now. The Philly had a great amount of cheese. The Reuben slathered on the thousand island dressing and was super flavorful. The Meatball had giant meatballs. All the sandwiches are incredibly filling. The bread really put these sandwiches over the top. I eat a lot and one of these sandwiches would fill me up. \n\nThe way it works is you grab a number at the deli, they call your number so you can order, then they call your number again when it is ready, then you take it outside to pay.

The chunks of avocado give me life and it is perfectly seasoned. It's a good amount for 2-3 people, if you order it and think uh I think that feeds more than 3 people, Christina, I'm a fatty, what can I say. \n\nPair it with the superbly thin and well-salted chips and it is a recipe for addiction. They do not hold back with the salt, and I am here for it. \n\nFREE CHIPS AND SALSA - It hurts my heart when I go someplace and they don't give free chips and salsa. Please always do this.\n\nCAMARONES SALAD - Yes, I continuously get the same salad. When I have so much other turmoil in my life, I'm looking at you my one-year-old son, I don't like to branch out with food anymore. This salad is delicious and nutritious. I'm so happy to have a light option when eating at a Mexican restaurant, because I know I'm eating all my calories with those chips and guac. \n\nSERVICE - You can get in and out in less than an hour. They know how to get food out during lunch hours. You would think this would be standard at any business during the week, but you'd be surprised. \n\nICE TEA - They bring out the ice tea and give you a little carafe (well, it actually looks like a Patron tequila bottle, but carafe sounds classier), so you can replenish your own tea. They even bring sweetener to the table. I love this.\n\nDESSERT - Free churros to round out the meal. It's the perfect amount of sweet to finish lunch.\n\nThe one negative is the parking situation. It continues to be impossible to find parking in the lot in front! This is a mall so of course you will find parking close by, but you might have to walk a bit. I ended up sucking it up and valeting (which was $5 not including gratuity), because I circled the parking lot once and then said screw it. There's nothing you can do about this, but add in five minutes to your drive time!", "date": "2019-10-16 15:47:22"}

The crowds are a bit much on the weekends, but I don't hold it against the establishment.  The crowd is always friendly and if you pick someone up here, there is a higher-than-average chance that they are a good conversationalist.\n\nI have a little criticism - The pommes frites are fantastic, but they are cursed with two major weaknesses - they are too small and soft.  When I dip them, they buckle, for their stiffness loses out to the surface tension of the spicy mayo dip.  As a result of this, I always end up getting spicy mayo on my fingers when I dip them.  I usually end up turning to using my fork to eat them halfway through the meal.  I don't enjoy doing this but I have no choice because they taste great.

I've been for lunch, dinner, happy hour, brunch, or just a quick beer in the middle of the afternoon.  I think I'm qualified to comment about this place.  I believe that Monk's success is due in large part to their ability to meet the needs of several audiences.  Let me explain.\n\nThe Beer Lovers- This is arguably the biggest group. Monk's is literally a legend in the beer world. Not just in Philly but across the country.  Their beer list is superb.  I once sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon with a couple who had driven for hours from Maryland just for the beer.  Not to have lunch.  Not to visit the Philly historic sites.  Just to drink beer at Monk's.  \n\nThe Mussel People- At the moment they have six flavors and people go crazy!  I've seen tables where patrons order pots of all six.  Trust me; these people are devoted to this place.\n\nThe Foodies- You can be surprised here.  How about \"Monk's Flemish Grilled Scallops\" as a starter?  Follow it with Salmon Framboise and if you love seafood you have one heck of a meal.  There are also plenty of choices for carnivores.  \n\nIf you are a newbie you may be a little surprised by the physical space.  There is a short dingy hallway that leads from the street to the main door.  The rooms are quirky, homey, and just a little bit beat up.  It all adds to the famous Monk's charm!

Once at Bern's, you wind your way through the massive foyer & hallway, then up the back stairs.  Pleasantly greeted by the host staff up there, they led us right away to our personal booth.\n\nThe booths are so cool-four people could fit very comfortably into the one we had.  They have a tiny jukebox that puts out good sound, and gives you your choice of different types of music.  We chose jazz, and that made a lovely backdrop.  The server was very prompt, and friendly, and knowledgeable - plus we loved that she knew how to work an assortment of smart phones since we wanted a bunch of pictures. \n\nTo start with, I had the Minted Chocolate Coffee:  Coffee, mint and chocolate liqueurs, topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.  Not too many ingredients - yet they forgot the shaved chocolate?  Very small glass, too.  But - very delicious.\n\nMilk is not my friend, so that definitely limited my options for dessert.  I ended up going with The Roasted Pineapple:  warm pineapple upside down cake, roasted pineapple ice cream (which I substituted a nice, white peach sorbet) and rum sauce.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole dessert sounded WAY better than it actually was. 1) Not warm 2) Where's the rum in the rum sauce? 3)  If they had actually cooked the cake a bit longer so that the sugar in the pineapple caramelized on the cake, it could have been 100% better.

At night I usually park in the nearby garage.The Baroque-style of architecture and the artwork of Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini add a real touch of class to this establishment. Bernini's is a very elegant stop along the main street of Ybor, and the locals flock there for an excellent Italian meal. \n\nWe asked to sit upstairs this afternoon since it was a bit chilly, and there was a breeze blowing through the open front door. Normally in our Florida weather the cool breeze would have been welcomed, but I certainly appreciated being able to sit upstairs along the windows and watch the people scurrying by below us. The pace of service was just right with our waiter offering several menu suggestions, and then letting us relax and have our business discussions without too much interruption.\n\nMy client ordered a delicious-looking Greco Roman wood-fired pizza which was made with green & Kalamata olives, red peppers, capers, grape tomatoes, Feta cheese, Mozzarella & plum tomato sauce. It looked great, and he seemed very happy with his choice. He boxed up some to take back to the office, but later confessed that he had a \"late day snack\".\n\nI ordered the Cigar City Chop salad (affectionately known as \"Bunny Chow\") and this delicious leafy-green treat contained provolone cheese, marinated artichoke hearts, Romaine lettuce, shaved carrots, toasted almonds, artfully-sliced pieces of salami, red onions, asparagus and grape tomatoes with a drizzle of Italian vinaigrette. The salad was quite large, and I thoroughly enjoyed eating something a bit lighter for lunch.\n\nThe lunch menu has lots of Bruschettas, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, risottos, and full-on entr\u00e9es for very affordable prices.

So because of that I definitely decided that it was going to take a special occasion for me to experience it firsthand. And Zahav delivered with amazing results!\n\nThere really isn't to much to say about Zahav that hasn't already been said in its previous 874 reviews. From the bargain of getting the Tayim or Chef's Tasting menu's, to the expansive wine list and innovative cocktail list, then factoring in the plentiful selections on the menu that make both vegetarians and carnivores beam with happiness, and having it delivered by attentive and extremely informative servers; Zahav delivered on all fronts perfectly.\n\nSince Tayim gives the dining party a selection of all the Salatims & Hummus, two Mezze per person, and a grilled over coals Al Ha'esh portion each at $39 a person; its definitely the best deal to get. Unless the Chefs Tasting Menu with a special entree steers you in that direction, which the lamb shoulder would have if it wasn't our first time. Savoring their incredible hummus at coffeehouses and at home thanks to Green Aisle Grocery has nowhere near prepared me for how incredible it was in person. whether it was beets, eggplant, black eyed peas, cucumber, and then some the salads were all refreshing and delivered just a hint of spice. The crispy haloumi and labne w/ chive sauce that came with the delicious fried cauliflower elevated Middle Eastern cheeses to unprecedented levels. The grilled duck hearts delivered the almost impossible result of being as unchewy as possible. And the marinated artichokes, squash konafi, and Yemenite soup were all winners. For my grilled portion I was beyond impressed by the lamb merguez and it squash, pumpkin seed, and harissa accompaniment. And the chocolate babka with marscarpone managed to tantalize my sweet tooth, as did the dark rum and chartreuse w/ honey combo that was my Man on the Moon cocktail.\n\nUltimately when it comes down to it Zahav has everything it takes to make it one of my top five dining destinations in Philly!.", "date": "2014-03-06 07:16:19"}

Hearing about it closing, deeply saddened generations of my friends & family.  time to mourn the loss of a stable & consistent friend in your life.\nRumors started flying about the establishment re-opening, no this could ' be true, it was too good to be true. Alas, the rumors were confirmed & our beloved Goody Goody was being resurected. My heart, mind & tummy all let for joy, oh what a glorious day.\nThe time finally arrives when I can visit this loved landmark, the food institution that had won over so many of our hearts.\nMy first mistake was not understanding the wait ap. I sent a message through the yelp ap, no bueno, you can't text them. You must call them & when it is quieting down, they text you, they will hold your place for 10 minutes. It took 2 hours & 21 minutes for my text to arrive. Luckily I snagged a seat at the snack bar in 5 minutes, while the line of people waiting continued to grow.\nI got the Hyde Park burger, w/ lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo & hold the pickles, onion rings & a chocolate shake...the excitement & anticipation grew. I waited.\nThe onion rings are da bomb, quite possibly the best I have ever eater. Light, crunchy exterior with the perfect onion ration, & a generous serving...too bad the dipping sauce was a mediocre version of thousand island dressing\nThe burger was nonexistent, the toppings were fresh & it tasted like a salad on a burger bun, though smaller than usual, way too big for burger & just an egg white, bland bun. I like Steak & Shake, but this burger was paper thin & you could not even taste it with the toppings, so disappointed. At least Krystal steams it's buns & it proportionate.  The milkshake I ordered & asked about three times never arrived, except on my check.\nI was sooooo let down, disappointed & truly sad. Forget the muffins & pies to take home, pay the bill & get out of dodge. The hostesses are a bit rude, but the waitress was great.\nI will return to try a meal. I am truly baffled, there are reviews on here by people who's opinion & foodie status, I really respect....all I can think is hype. I realize there are different burgers & we all have favorites, but this was not even adequate protien for a child. Everything being a side to your enter burger can add up quickly\nWait in line, no never, definately  not woth me wasting my time over. Wake up Tampa, we want more of the original Goody Goody.\nWhat's a girl to do? Call me very disapointed & looney tunes to think people will wait in line for hours for brash greeting & insufficient food.", "date": "2016-09-04 17:21:37"}

It's in close walking distance from the Convention Center and the Tampa Marriott Waterside.\n\nWe've been here several times, usually for a weekend lunch when we can sit outside on the balcony looking back into Downtown Tampa. We've also sat at the sushi bar in the evenings if we're planning to go Downtown to see a concert or a even a play at the Performing Arts Center. And, for the last two years in a row we've been there for the big New Year's Eve celebration.\n\nEach experience has been completely different, ranging from a calm and romantic luncheon to a complete zoo on the dance floor for the big party nights. If you're there for a nice meal, then I recommend sitting on the balcony (weather permitting) because the view cannot be beat. The lunch menu has plenty of soups, salads, sandwiches, and small versions of their regular entrees. There's also a full sushi menu with nigiri, sashimi, and a wide variety of rolls.\n\nAt night you have the option of the sushi menu, or high-end cuisine served in an elegant atmosphere. Service can be hit or miss, which is a shame since this is such a showcase restaurant for the Tampa area. The dance club is a lot of fun, but some nights it can get insanely crowded.\n\nThis has always been one of my favorite spots for a business luncheon or a fancy dinner for an out-of-town client who wants a view of the Tampa skyline.", "date": "2013-06-30 03:46:16"}

Finally he parks the car on a side street, under the highway, and we march around the corner to find ourselves standing in front of the original location of Tony Luke's.

At Frank's urging I ordered a Roast Beef Italian with Provolone and grilled onions and a side of onion rings.\n\nHOLY WOW!!!!

But for just about every single occasion that I've previously tried I couldn't bear to wait for the 30-60 minute wait that  would have been involved to get in. But it finally took the good karma of a lunch bonding session with my dad to get in, and as soon as we did I understood the reason behind the waiting. Between the few marble tables, and classic wooden barscape, the interior of VW is pretty freaking tiny and packed uncomfortably together; which is the only reason that it gets 4 stars.\n\nOther than the packed interior the first thing that I noticed was the attentive service that comes with every Garces establishment. From filling water to giving good suggestions and information they never missed a beat. And from the start of sampling the house selection of pickles which was Salsify, red onions, and a fresh kalamata olive spread to go with the bread; we quickly noticed the excellence of the food.\n\nFrom the get go my intention was to savor a burger and their incredible duck fat fries. But I didn't start things off with their legendary Maple Bourbon Glazed Cipollini onion and foie gras topped Whiskey King just yet. Instead I took full advantage of the customization that the Village Burger yielded by adding applewood bacon, Rogue Bleu Cheese, and truffled portebello mushrooms to created the perfect bacon blue burger.

Everything about our experience was fantastic. \n\nLet's just start with the service. Our server was bubbly (but not overly so), helpful, sweet, and fun! We walked in a little after 7:15 on a Monday night (they're NOT closed on Mondays, despite what the Yelp listing says!) and it was practically empty, which didn't bother me at all -- we were able to be seated right away! Score. \n\nOur server went over the specials of the day. Half-off smothered fries, double order of wings for the price of one, and $3 draft beers. SWEET!\n\nThe smothered fries sounded AMAZING, so we went with those to start. Hot crispy seasoned fries in a creamy rich cheese sauce, topped with MORE cheese and rib meat? How could anyone resist something like THAT? Bring. It. On. \n\nThey were delicious, of course...especially dipped in the 3 yummy BBQ sauces that the Shaved Duck offers. I don't remember the exact names of the sauces, but there was one sweet one, one spicy one, and a smoky one. All three were delicious (BBQ sauce IS my fave condiment, after all), but the sweet one stole my heart. \n\nFor the entree I went with the duck flatbread, which was DELISH! Thin crispy flatbread topped with duck, tomatoes, some sort of sweet cheese. \n\nAndy ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. WOW! The brisket was so tender and juicy, and the croissant that it was on was perfect! Soft and warm. The mac and cheese was creamy and rich. Not the best mac I've had, but close! \n\nI was so stuffed by the end of the meal, but when I found out they had bread pudding on the dessert menu, I HAD to go for it. I'm glad I did! It was almond brioche bread pudding, with a rich amaretto sauce. It was delicious, and tasted a bit like a cinnamon roll and a LOT like heaven. Perfect way to end the meal. \n\nI was impressed by the flatbread, but I'm going to have DREAMS about their brisket.

Why?  Because the kitchen is too small and understaffed.   \n3) And worse: because the inside seating area is tiny most of the hungry wait outside in a humongous eating area.

My Hemingway's meal with a $9 glass of sangria cost a total of $27 today! My daughters pizza which was an individual size was $15! And my hubs bbq $20! Especially because you are not getting table service here. So definitely not a place we will frequent but a nice place to come once in a while. The crowds vary -- so you'll have people dressed up to people dressed for casual, so you shouldn't feel out of place no matter the attire. I actually hate the concept of searching for a table when we come here -- it truly stresses me out!", "date": "2019-08-12 02:15:16"}

We started with the wings and then shared the veggie burger and curry. Everything was delicious. The wings could've used more of a kick, as could the curry (I would not classify either as \"medium\" heat - closer to mild in my opinion). But the flavor on everything was quite yummy. The rast-a-far fries were good, but not as great as I had hoped and I'd probably go with sweet potato fries next time. Our server was excellent - I do not remember her name, but she had brown hair with bangs and did a fantastic job. Only complaint is that there were a lot of people smoking right around the outdoor tables - I wish Ella's would prohibit that because it's really unpleasant if you're a nonsmoker trying to enjoy dinner.

And I loathed trying its horrendous stall inside the Reading Terminal Market. But it took forever and my friends birthday for me to finally get out there and sample some of its original Chinatown fire. And while part of me saw a glimmer of why it has earned such praise and recognition over the years, there was also part of me who found it to be just decent.\n\nAs many have alluded to before its cash only so come prepared. There is an ATM on sight if you need to swing otherwise, but be forewarned since its a rather shady looking one (http://www.philebrity.com/2012/05/02/places-we-dont-understand-the-atm-at-sang-kee-peking-duck-house/). For a spot with two floors a number of the tables felt rather cramped together. While part of could be due to the fact that we were a 2 round table birthday group, ours was compacted closely to another rather large group which gave off the feeling of dueling conversations at times. The lightening fast and attentive service did make up for it though.\n\nWhile the menu DEFINITELY yields a number of impressive sounding entrees and starters, it can also be a massive and overwhelming ordeal to sift through. I also couldn't help but notice that things like pork belly in chili oil, and Dan Dan Noodles were suddenly added to a new specialty menu. I wonder what influenced that decision (http://www.yelp.com/biz/han-dynasty-philadelphia)? being in the house of Peking duck I knew that I at least had to get it as an appetizer. But for its signature item, it left me feeling rather underwhelmed and really didn't offer up anything that made it stand out from the many other Chinatown options that have it on the menu. The triple seafood delight of shrimp, scallops, and squid was a spicy and plentiful step in the right direction. But I've had several seafood dishes at similar spots that I do consider to be equals.\n\nIf I were to compare Chinatown restaurants to cheesesteak places, I certainly won't go as far as to call Sang Kee a Pat's or Geno's. But it does add up to a somewhat better than Jim's equivalent, and if you take a good walk around it won't be long before you come across several other options that are better and more accessible.", "date": "2012-06-18 06:42:29"}

My grandparents used to live in the small town of Wildwood north of Ocala, and our summer vacations consisted of trips to see them followed by days at the beach and days at Busch Gardens.\n\nThe park opened way before my time in 1959 as a special hospitality area for Anheuser-Busch of Tampa, with it's famed tasting room and bird sanctuary. In 1965 Busch Gardens opened the area known as Serengeti Plains, and stocked the Plains with African wildlife which were allowed to roam freely. Over the years, Busch Gardens has continued to focus on its tropical landscape, exotic animals, and thrill ride amusements to draw visitors.\n\nBusch Gardens is a relatively small park with 335 acres inside their fences. That includes 25 total rides, of which 8 are classified as roller coasters, and 3 are water attractions. The park hosted well over 4 million people last year, placing in the Top 20 of the most-visited theme parks in the US and in the Top 25 worldwide.\n\nFlorida Resident annual passes cost $156 for Busch Gardens, and that includes free parking, discounts on dining, shopping, and special admission events, and no blackout dates. In my book this is THE best value for any amusement park in Florida, and one of the best amusement park experiences in the country.\n\nYes, it has changed a lot over the years -- fan favorites such as the Anheuser-Busch tasting room and Rhino Rally are long gone, and the Park has confirmed that the Gwazi wooden roller coaster is coming down soon. In their place, new attractions such as SheiKra, Cheetah Hunt, and Falcon's Fury have sprung up around the park. Today Busch Gardens is a combination African wildlife exhibit, thrill ride / coaster junkie experience, and some high quality song / dance / ice skating / acrobatic production shows.\n\nBusch Gardens has over ten different themed areas within the park, and more than a dozen animal attraction spots. There is now an Animal Care Center on the premises, and park visitors are welcome to watch the veterinarians as they perform exams and medical procedures on the wildlife. The park has some behind-the-scenes tours which allow visitors to venture out onto the Serengeti on specially-built Busch Gardens vehicles, and feed some of the animals.  \n\nAs for the thrill rides, hang on to your seats because Busch Gardens is one of the best coaster-junkie meccas in America. Rides such as Kumba and Montu, are now joined by Cheetah Hunt, SheiKra, and Falcon's Fury for screaming good times by all. Busch Gardens still has the Skyride and the Serengeti Railway for those who enjoy a slightly tamer ride.\n\nIf you prefer live-action shows then you'll find a constantly-changing number of family-friendly productions featuring costumed characters, live animals, singing, dancing, and acrobatic performers. The shows change by season, so make sure that you check the daily schedule to see what's happening.\n\nThroughout the year Busch Gardens has a number of special events for their guests, and those include Christmas Town, Howl-O-Scream, the Real Music Series, Bands, Brew & BBQ, Viva La Musica!, Summer Nights, and a Food & Wine Festival to name a few.\n\nBusch Gardens has been incredibly generous to the Tampa Bay Yelp community for the past several years, offering us a limited number of free VIP admission tickets and front-of-the-line passes during the Holiday season, and for Howl-O-Scream. They are class people, running a fantastic home-town amusement park.", "date": "2014-12-31 04:44:05"}

We went for an early dinner on New Year's Eve. First stop - the bar, to try the cucumber gimlet every Yelper raves about. 10/10 - this might be my new favorite gin drink ever.  Cool, refreshing, and delightful. The bartenders were superb: friendly, efficient, and funny, and made some very helpful dinner suggestions.  Tip:  don't get started on the complimentary truffle popcorn, because it is addicting!\n\nFor dinner, we were sat at high top table for two, in what seemed to be the more casual outside bar area.  The table was wobbly on the tile floors, so I went to ask the hostess if we could be moved to a regular table. She was instantly accommodating, with no hesitation or eye roll, even though I know it was a busy night with seating planned well in advance.\n\nWe were moved to what very well may have been the best table in the house - outside dining area, right next to the beautiful pond, with a full moon overhead.  Stunning!  Even though it was a cool night, they had heaters overhead which made it perfectly comfortable.\n\nOur server, Cole, was completely on the ball; I feel we had better service here than I've ever had at my other favorite restaurant in the area. We started with both the ahi tuna tartare and beef tartare. The tuna was some of the best I've had, stacked on crunchy noodles. Generous portion of tartare, served with delicious crostinis.\n\nYikes, this is getting long, so I'll just say that I loved my blackened snapper, even though it was a touch overcooked, and the side dish of tater tots stuffed with cheese was crazy good, although could have been served hotter.\n\nThe one and only disappointment of the night was the dessert of carrot cake.  OP - how could you fail me here? Get yourself a new baker, or order it from a local place, but don't have this as your featured dessert! It was not moist, served too cool, with not nearly enough frosting on top, side, or between layers. And what was with the odd pineapple sauce on the plate? Anyway, it was a fail. Our server instantly removed it from our bill, once he could see how bummed we were.\n\nGreat evening from start to finish and we will definitely be going back for my birthday dinner!", "date": "2018-01-03 17:16:40"}

Because there are 2 good rides.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI'm probably spoiled from growing up in Houston (Six Flags Astroworld) and spending many summers in Cleveland (Cedar Point.)  Astroworld was unfortunately closed down in 2005, but they had about 12 big thrill rides before going under.  Cedar Point is the #1 park in the world with 17 roller coasters and a handful of other thrill rides.  Busch Gardens has 5 roller coasters, and 3 of them are either boring or just painful.  \n\nGwazi: 1/5 *****\n\nDo not ever ride this.  It hurts.  It is not fun in any way, shape or form.  There is a sign outside of the ride that says, \"New smoother track installed for 2011.\"  I don't want to call this a lie, but it's completely untrue.  Is that a nicer way of saying it?  The track feels like it was installed in 1968 and has never once even been sprayed with an ounce of WD-40.  I would actually give this ride a negative rating, because you will need a deep tissue massage when you're done with it.\n\nKumba 2/5 *****\n\nIt's not painful, but it's a ride that you could fall asleep on.  It's incredibly boring as there are no feelings of \"G-Force\" at any point.\n\nMontu 2/5 *****\n\nSimilar to Kumba, but slightly more exciting.  There are no G-Force moments, but it has the slight edge over Kumba.  We'll officially give Montu 2.2 stars.\n\nShiekra 5/5 *****\n\nShiekra is a great ride.  Being suspended at the top of the hill as you stare down at your death is awesome.  It's even at about a 110 degree inverse angle to add to the horror.  No matter how many times I ride it, I am nervous waiting in line.  That's when you know the ride is good.  I got a couple of butterflies just thinking about it.\n\nCheetah Hunt 5/5 *****\n\nCheetah Hunt is a pioneer in the new generation of roller coasters.  As we move forward, the days of the 200, 300 and 400 foot hills will slowly dissolve with new thrill rides.  Cheetah Hunt does not have any huge hills, but the ride is all about precision of the turns and placement of quicker, smaller hills with speed boosters built in.  The G-Forces are plentiful in this ride despite its biggest drop only being 130 feet.\n\nAnimal Exhibits 4/5 *****\n\nThe Lion area was definitely the highlight of any animal sightings.  There was a large window into one of the Lion's den that was gathering a huge crowd.  One of the Lions was standing on the ledge trying to directly interact with the people watching.  He/she was standing upright and pawing at the window in a non-aggressive manner, and it was a sight to be seen.  \n\nThe animal exhibits are a nice touch to the park, but they definitely create an incredible amount of walking space to get from one attraction to the next.  Be prepared for a ton of walking.  In terms of any animal related attractions, Lowry Park Zoo is a much cheaper alternative.  LPZ is only a couple of miles from Busch Gardens and has just about everything you would find at Busch.\n\nThe bottom line is that Busch Gardens is essentially good for two roller coasters.  You could walk in, ride Cheetah Hunt, ride Shiekra and leave.  Unfortunately it's a pricey ticket for a couple hours of line waiting and four minutes of coaster riding.", "date": "2012-01-25 18:27:29"}

Now, some of these places might have spectacular food, but until I discover that, I won't be seeking out this place (and I will rely on Yelp reviews in half a year or so to determine whether there is a place I really need to try).\n\nThat being said, heck yes if I have a visitor from out of town I will take him/her here. I have friends visiting and this was my first thought for food. It's different and when I want to showcase the best of Tampa Bay, I will come here. The view of the river is gorgeous and the d\u00e9cor of this place is beautiful. Also, I don't have to worry about people finding something they like because there are so many options.\n\nWe came at about 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday which is prime eating time. Luckily we were still able to find a table. We wanted to eat outside and those were all taken. This place does parking so well! It could have been a complete hassle, but instead it was smooth sailing. Yes, some of the parking attendants didn't seem to care too much about directing traffic, but the lot is so huge that once I was pointed in the right direction I didn't really need anything else. \n\nThere was a live DJ spinning and it added to the trendiness of the place. My husband commented that he's never seen so many hip people in his life in Tampa Bay. They all come out of the woodworks to come here. \n\nThis is a must see when you're in Tampa and I am glad that we have this new addition to the city.", "date": "2018-04-27 14:40:27"}

The burger was nice a juicy, the bun they use on it tastes great, and they don't overload the burger with too many toppings. The size of the burger was pretty big too, though it's not as cheap as say McDonald's or Steak N Shake. You pay for quality though. The french fries were tasty as well, more like homemade fries than the kind found in fast food places, yet tastier than those made by places such as The Cheesecake Factory or Ruby Tuesdays. \n\nMy parents ordered Papa a La Huancaina and devoured it upon receiving it, my Mom citing it's excellent taste, and she's has tons of experience with Peruvian food so I'll take her word for it. \n\nThe waitress was friendly and quick to pick up drinks and get our orders in.

Understand your place as a damn good serving of soft pretzels but don't try to steal the limelight from your compatriots.  Bide your time until improvements can be made before trying to tackle your enemies.\n\nHerb Cherry Tomatoes - Approachability is a double edged sword.

Stay away from people who will die if they find something very delicious because you will kill them.\n\nTruffle Lemon Artichokes - You are less approachable than the Herb Cherry Tomatoes but everything else in its horoscope applies to you.\n\nTater Tots - You've finally achieved your goal of making people rethink what a tater tot should taste like.  Take the time to appreciate this but don't get caught up in self-admiration.  Apathy will breed contempt and you must move on to the next life challenge.\n\nSpicy Popcorn Shrimp - You must move quickly because everyone will want a piece of you.  You are served with a delicious buffalo aoli that has made you a prime target for attack.  Keep your head down, lest you be ravaged by the horde.\n\nVillage Burger with Caramelized Onions and a fried Egg - You are served on an ideal sesame roll and are probably the best tasting burger in Philadelphia.  Take time out today to revel in your greatness, but remain humble.  Arrogance will breed strong competitors.\n\n--\nSeriously, Village Whiskey gets 5 stars based on the basic Village burger alone.

But it was an accomplishment, even though the door was clearly marked EXIT ONLY -- but I saw no other door. \n\nThen I sat at the table for a number of minutes before I realized everybody in our UYE group was just getting into the cafeteria-style line to meet up at the table. Whoopsie, Dumbo, again!!\n\nSo I got in line, somewhere close to the soda machine. Many people were getting their beverages right there. I didn't do that, 'cause I didn't know if I was getting a meal that included beverage.\n\nThe line moved fairly quickly. I was amazed at the number of offerings, especially sides, that weren't on the website. So, I was stupefied and needed at least 90 minutes to figure out what I was getting.\n\nWhile in line, a sign on butcher paper was posted that they were out of brisket. The woman behind me was getting a carryout for brisket, and she was devastated.\n\nBut, as we approached the front, it was clear that they still had brisket. But only 10 pounds, so they were anticipating being out. That sign should be posted much earlier in the trek through the cafeteria line . . . as should all the additional offerings, so people can make up their mind what they want.\n\nI ordered half a rack of baby back ribs. Comes with two sides and a beverage for $14.\n\nThe woman in front of me was curious about the truffled root veggie salad, and so was I. She asked for a sample, and was gladly offered a generous sample. She said it was too mayonnaise-y for her. I was in.\n\nFor my other side, I got the much-proclaimed macaroni and cheese.\n\nSo this total cafeteria style thing works like a conveyor belt. Order your meat first. It's put on a butcher paper lined baking sheet. Goes on top of the sneeze guard and moves down to the \"sides\" section. That's where you get your red-and-white containers of sides.\n\nThen you pick up your tray and go to the pay station. I had to ask if this was where you pay. And I was so ensconced with paying for my meal that I totally didn't see the pickles, onions and peppers.\n\nI got my beverage at the beverage station in front of the store. So there are two, and I didn't have to battle through the waiting crowds to get the Lucky Club Zero-Calorie cola, which was divine.

YIPPEE!!\n\nThe Food:\nThe ribs were fabulous; I ate two and took the rest home.\n\nSandy offered a piece of her brisket, and it was great. Smoky tender. Moist (not a word I use, 'cause it's my most hated word). Pull-away good.\n\nThe truffled root veggie salad was OK. BUT I took it home, and it was MUCH, MUCH better appropriately chilled. It was simply white potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery, green onions, white onions and mayonnaise. I do not claim to understand the truffle concept. But this was a GREAT salad CHILLED.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese was small shells and gloopy. BUT I took it home, and it was MUCH, MUCH better appropriately heated.\n\nI had hefty to-go vessels. And I asked for pickles. She put four in a container. I ate two, then went back for more to pack into my container. Those pickles were AWESOME!!\n\nMessage to SugarFire: CHILL your salads, HEAT your sides appropriately.

Both my parents were raised in San Francisco so all my extended family lives there. I would visit multiple times a year growing up and now my sister lives in L.A. so I still travel at least once a year to the West Coast. I wouldn't call myself a dim sum expert, but I do have a bar set that might be a little above the average person. Do not come here expecting San Francisco (or New York, or Shanghai, or even Sydney, random fact, Sydney has fantastic dim sum which they more often refer to as yum cha) level dim sum, but do come here expecting a rather tasty meal.\n\nLike the other Yummy House (not the one that burned down, but the one on Hillsborough), even though there are carts coming around, you'll want to order off the menu. You will starve if you think you can wait for the carts. We ended up seeing maybe a total of three carts the entire time we were there. Unfortunately, the only dishes you can order off the dim sum menu are the special dishes at the bottom. Otherwise, you have to wait for the cart. This is why we never got shumai (pork dumplings), we never saw it on the cart! There were four of us and this is what we got.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken wings (off the menu) - Yummy House does salt and pepper dishes very well. I've always been a fan of their squid and tofu and their chicken wings are no exception. They have a sweetness to the seasoning that complements the saltiness really well. This was one of my favorite dishes.\n\nXOXO noodles (off the dim sum menu) - I enjoyed the noodle texture, but there wasn't enough sauce. This was my husband's favorite dish, so to each their own. I would have really enjoyed it if it had more sauce.\n\nChinese broccoli (off the dim sum menu) - I thought this dish was done well. It was crunchy, tasty, and had just enough oyster sauce drizzled on it. I'd get it again.\n\nSeafood Congee (off the dim sum menu) - This dish was very bland. I had to add salt and pepper to give it some taste. There were good chunks of fish in it. I probably won't try it again.\n\nChinese doughnuts (off the dim sum menu) - One of my dining companion loves eating this with congee. I thought it was good, but can you really screw up fried dough?

I really liked it. I've had some bad shrimp dumplings recently and this one was a welcome relief. The shrimp was cooked well.\n\nCrab and shrimp dumplings (off the cart) - Same thoughts as the shrimp dumpling. The crab gave it enough of a different taste from just shrimp. I would get it again.\n\nPork buns (off the cart) - Couldn't try it since I don't eat pork, but my husband said he could eat three of these himself.\n\nTripe (off the cart) - I thought this was really tasty. I'm a huge tripe fan. It wasn't cut too thick or chewy. I would get it again.\n\nEgg tarts (guy walking around with it) - It was nice and flaky. It had a good flavor. I would get it again.\n\nEverything above came out to about $64 not including tip. I found that reasonable for Tampa Bay Dim Sum (this isn't the dirt cheap dim sum you can find in San Fran). Huge tip, make a reservation. Shocking, I know, that they take reservations, but that meant we were seated right away even though there was a 20-minute wait.", "date": "2018-03-09 15:11:55"}

Service was extremely attentive but they honored the red/green signaling devices given to each patron.   And if you have the \"green side up\" you get a constant flow of varied grilled/roasted meats...many cuts of beef, plus chicken, pork and sausage.  All were well seasoned & prepared and you could get some variation in the degree of rare/well-done by directing the slicing.  The top sirloin was the best to my taste, but filet mignon and parmesan pork were also notable.\n\n They also offer a salad bar only option at a lesser price, and the selection is also impressive...many cheeses, unique greens, hams, sausages, shrimps, salmon,  potatoes, pickles, heart of palm, and about 4 soups, including a marvelous lobster bisque.  So even with the salad bar you get a full range of dishes, including plenty of meat & other protein. Special South American/Tropical  drinks were available & delicous, including several caprinhas (sp?), a Brazilian specialty.\n\nThis outlet is located on Boy Scout, which is the wiggle between W.

Because the hype was big, but the product delivered.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nIs this the most hyped a restaurant has been in my near-decade in Tampa? If it's not #1, it's at least on Mount Rushmore. And sometimes hype can lead to over-hype, which is no fun for anyone involved.\n\nBut over-hype didn't happen. Goody Goody delivered. Big time.\n\nI moved to Tampa Bay in 2007, a couple of years after Goody Goody closed down. To be honest, I'd never even heard of it. But I think the idea of resurrecting of an old, beloved brand is absolutely amazing. That being said, I knew nothing about Goody Goody, before my visit this weekend. I actually thought it was primarily a burger place. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nIt's hard to truly classify Goody Goody. It's like an upscale diner, but still very casual. When I say upscale, I strictly mean in quality of food. This is far from Waffle House. But the menu is wide and varied - they did a great job creating a menu that tempts me to come back at least a dozen times to try everything. \n\nBut on our first visit, we ordered two POX Cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings and mac-n-cheese. For dessert I grabbed a slice of butterscotch pie and a cafe con leche to help me awaken from my food coma.\n\nEverything ranged from good to great. In terms of the burgers, I think Goody Goody will be Tampa Bay's version of In-N-Out. It's not like an In-N-Out burger, but it's very addicting in its own way. I could definitely see these burgers having a cult following. \n\nI actually didn't want onion rings, but my fiance thought they looked great in the photos, and decided to order them. This was an excellent choice - they were the best I've ever had. Sometimes onion rings are so heavily breaded/fried, that they sit in my stomach like a rock afterward. Not the case with these bad boys!\n\nThe fries were far from basic - thick and seasoned, just like I like 'em! And the mac-n-cheese had little bits of ham in it. It tasted simple but delicious.\n\nThe butterscotch pie was indeed sweet, but that's what dessert is supposed to be, right? The cafe con leche (from Naviera!) was as amazing as expected.\n\nThe interior of Goody Goody is exactly as you'd expect - the classic diner look, revamped and modernized. It's not a a very large place, which definitely leads to some long wait times. But I have a solution for you!\n\n*****Here's the most crucial PRO TIP I've ever offered*****\n\nDownload the No Wait app (just recently purchased by Yelp),\u00a0put your name on the list a couple hours before you want to eat, keep tabs on the wait time, and show up when it tells you to. You can completely bypass all the craziness and waiting!\n\nI'll be back here. A lot.

He is obsessed and is your biggest fan. I've therefore visited a handful of times and I'm not mad about it. \n\nLet's dish about the dishes: \n\nOn the House Classic Pastas- They have a list of house pastas that if you order from, you also get to choose another entire dish from the menu to take home with you. Seriously awesome. This is the only restaurant I've been to that does this and it's definitely memorable. \n\nLighter Take Chicken Parmesan- My absolute favorite. It's healthier than the normal Chicken Parmesan dish, and honestly is even more delicious. Win win! The chicken is only slightly breaded and the the sauce on the pasta is light and has fresh tomatoes mixed in. So wonderful. They have 'lighter takes' of several dishes which is nice to see health taken into consideration. \n\nChicken and Roasted Pepper Flatbread- It was good, but it was a lot of one thing. I'd definitely get this more as an appetizer with a large group next time instead of my full meal! \n\nLasagna- The dish my husband comes back for and thinks about in his dreams. Thanks for being his favorite dish in America so far! \n\nThis place is well-run, huge and does efficient catering and pick-up as well.", "date": "2018-06-06 12:53:05"}

I get to give The Shaved Duck their 5th Star back. I'm a big fan of Burnt Ends and TSD has the best ones in the city and county. They smoke for hours, so they're only available after 5 PM. So I highly recommend that you get there right at Happy Hour, because chances are they may sell out. After hours of being smoked, they then toss'm in my favorite sauce - Black Isle. Pair these Burnt Ends with an ice cold craft beer and you've got the perfect start to a BBQ feast. (For some, it could be a meal) However, on this night, I pigged out and continued to eat. \n\nSeriously, I skipped lunch so I could totally pig out here at The Shaved Duck. After devouring my entire order of Burnt Ends. (I was dining alone, so no one to share with and I kinda liked it that way). Next I ordered the B.O.S.S., it was the \"must order\" recommendation from Ian Froeb on his STL 100 list this year. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the thinly sliced Tri-Trip, smothered in bacon swiss sauce and topped with onion rings. The sandwich came with one side, I choose the Hand Cut Fries. Being a huge fan of Brussels Sprouts, I also ordered a second side of them. In my old age, sprouts have become one of my two favorite vegetables. \n\nI sipped my Charleville Tornado Alley at the high top table in the front window of the bar area and waited patiently for my food. Soon I saw a young man different from my original server approaching with a tray of goodies. He first sat down my Saut\u00e9ed Brussels Sprouts, then Hand Cut Fries with a Little Cup of Ketchup and finally my BIG sandwich. He smiled, told me to enjoy my food and walked away. When I took a closer look at the sandwich, there was no meat on it. It was a vegetarian sammie. Did I mistakenly order the wrong thing? I couldn't have, or did I. The young man re-entered the room and I waved him to him. When he came over, I told him I had ordered the B.O.S.S. and he quickly corrected the error. \n\nMy server was going on break after she placed my order and was also ordering her own dinner to enjoy. It was a simple absent minded error, she ordered her sandwich as mine. They box up the mistake and let me have it as well. It made an excellent lunch at the next day work. The Brussels Sprouts, tomatoes, red pepper with a smoked habanero sauce was still full of flavor. \nWhen my server came back from break, she apologized deeply. I told her no worries and we had a good laugh at how it happened. \n\nBack to my original sandwich, The B.O.S.S. is totally the boss. The Tri-Trip was tender. The Bacon Swiss Sauce was finger licking good and the crispy onion rings gave it a crunch and additional flavor. My Saut\u00e9ed Brussels Sprouts were done to perfection. They were done to the point that they were just soft enough, but still had a little snap to them. Then the hand cut fries, crispy coating and a hot meaty potato inside. If you follow my reviews, you know I love my ketchup served in little cups. So seeing it served that way here, made me smile. \n\nMy \"must order\" is the Burnt Ends, so next time you are at The Shaved Duck - order them and enjoy. \n\nWhen: May 17, 2016\nWhy: Burnt Ends and Ian Froeb's STL 100", "date": "2016-07-20 23:48:34"}

We knew that The Refinery changes their menu each week in accordance with whatever is fresh and available to the chef. As a result, my foodie friend Brian and I had a few choices in our back pocket and we were eager to give this place a try.\n\nThe Refinery sits along N. Florida Avenue a few blocks south of Hillsborough Avenue and across the street from Mauricio Faedo's Bakery. The Refinery looks like a typical Seminole Heights home with a downstairs kitchen and dining room, and upstairs full-service beer and wine bar and outdoor rooftop deck seating. We chose to sit downstairs, but next time I'd like to sit out on the balcony.\n\nGiven the eclectic and cozy nature of the restaurant, the menu is actually printed as your placemat on a wooden table. They make no apologies for chipped plates, mismatched silverware, and drinking from Mason jars, and go on to explain that they prefer to put the focus on the food and keep the prices reasonable. A meal here feels like a quirky dinner party in someone's home, and not a highfalutin white tablecloth / stuffy ma\u00eetre d' experience. \n\nChef Baker talks about setting the bar high when it comes to what they put on the plate. If it wasn't grown in Florida or produced using ethically sound methods, you probably won't find it at The Refinery. They make sure each ingredient is of the highest quality and comes from folks who take great pride and care of their processes, employees, and earthly footprint. That mission statement is the essence of The Refinery.\n\nBrian and I each had a glass of wine - his was the Estampa Chardonnay and mine was the Argentinian La Yunta Torrontes (excellent red wine!). We followed that with The Refinery's house salad made with very fresh mixed greens, braised radish, sliced strawberries, Cuban croutons, and a lime / shallot / tarragon vinaigrette.\n\nFor the main courses he ordered the Massaman lamb curry, and I had the roasted chicken which turned out to be half of a seasoned and roasted chicken served with a side of diced ham, collard greens, black eyed peas sitting atop halves of a buttermilk biscuit, and then covered with caramelized sweet onion jam and chipotle sawmill gravy. The meal was absolutely spectacular, and very much lived up to our expectations. Total bill was well under $100 for the two of us.\n\nThe Refinery is open 7 days a week for dinner starting at 5pm, and on Sundays they are also open from 11am - 2:30pm for brunch.

I was between 3 and 4 stars, but rounded up because I feel like service is usually good, cocktails are consistently great, and desserts have been a win every time.\n\nI have had items here that are so amazing I can't stop talking about them - for example, they had a corned beef pho for St. Patrick's Day (which is now on their regular menu, I think) which was SO incredibly delicious, I could not stop raving about it.  Ditto on the s'more brownie they had the other day-outstanding.  The buffalo cauliflower was surprisingly excellent (it's bad for you, yet good for you!).  And I loved the Dachos - their version of nachos with chili, cheese, sour cream and onions on homemade potato chips-yum!\n\nIn the 'miss' column however: the other night they had a salad special-I don't have the exact description, but it was described as a salad with crabmeat, bacon, onions, etc.  Sounds great, right?  And it had an awesome presentation with the filling scooped into two gorgeous small heads of lettuce. I had filled up on the Dachos, so I only ate one lettuce head, and saved the other for the next day. Opened it up the next day, and was surprised to see the actual amount of crabmeat/bacon/onions filling - at most there were 2 teaspoons splayed across the top and inside the tiny crevice in the middle. No wonder all I tasted was lettuce the night before! I wish I had taken a picture of the salad once I had deconstructed it - I think I was just in shock that they would serve something like that.\n\nI do love that they are constantly updating both their food menus and their cocktail menus - so it's pretty safe to order most things on their menu; they are the tried and true winner items. I would just show some caution with the specials of the day - some obviously still need work.\n\nFinal thought:  Datz - crank up your air conditioning - our entire party was fanning themselves with their menus the other night- not cool!

My favorite thing to get is the corn dogs and french fries in Timbuktu with a drink, which can total seven to ten dollars.

When Pappy's is good, he is damn good and that is what keeps me coming back hoping that they are on their A-Game the day I am visiting.\n\nI was thrilled when Pappy's opened and was serving their Ribs as a Dry Rub with the sauce on the side.

Open a can and order one of the other sides. \n\nGreen Beans - Good  & gets one of your daily green vegetables in for the day. \n\nApple Sauce - Grandma smiles. \n\nWhen having a busy day at home or work our favorite E-Z Carry-Out is the #2. When doing a carry-out, there is no need to worry about the sauce, they give you plenty of all three. My personal favorite is the Sweet Baby Jane. I just hope she doesn't grow up to be like Betty Davis in, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\". The Holly Hot Sauce, which is suppose to be Texas style would make any true Texan laugh. It is very mild. \n\nPatience is a virtue and it is one you need to have when visiting Pappy's. No matter what time of day I have visited, I have stood in a very long line.

I went with the red sangria figuring it would go well with dinner. It was made with a brandy so a little stronger than the sangria that I'm used to.

Nothing was bad, but none of it stood out as amazing. The steak was a bit unique with extra charr on the outside, but the flavor was just ok. The butter candle contraption was a nice touch, but the lobster just seemed a bit underwhelming. The mac-n-cheese and potato were on par with what you'd find at a Chili's.\n\nBut the 3-star review gets upgraded to a 4-star because our favorite part was the dessert and Ocean Prime comp'd it for our anniversary.

She made sure that we were taken care of and had everything that we could possibly need. The entire staff was on point and everything was perfect.\n\nLooking over the menu, everything sounded so amazing and decadent. I decided to start with the turtle soup. Commander's is famous for their turtle soup and I have never had better in the city. It was full of amazing flavor and topped with sherry to add a little more kick. For my entree, I enjoyed the pecan crusted Gulf fish. This fish was cooked to perfection and topped with tender crab meat. It was served in a delectable cream sauce which complimented the flavors of the fish perfectly. For a side, I got the goat cheese stone ground grits, since I am on a tad of a grits kick. They were delicious, but I had to add a little more salt to them. I totally understand why they weren't salted and this wasn't a big deal. The grits were tasty and I really enjoyed them.\n\nFor dessert, I decided on the pecan pie- one of my favorites, topped with home spun vanilla ice cream. This sugary treat was the perfect end to this memorable meal.\n\nAt the beginning of the meal, I was asked if I was celebrating anything and when I told them it was my birthday, they added balloons to the table and brought me a chef's hat to wear. It was a nice touch and a lot of fun. They even put a candle in my pecan pie as part of the celebration.\n\nThere's a reason Commander's Palace is considered one of the best restaurants in New Orleans.

None of us finished the plaintains.\n\nNow on to the other aspects of this joint...the service was good - but my one complaint was that the waitstaff looked pretty disheveled. One girl in particular looked like she hadn't brushed her hair for a week. \n\nOverall I think we ordered too much food for 4 people, as 8-10 dishes would have covered it. The tacos come in sets of 3, but they will make them in other increments so you can share easily with your table. We got 4 tacos for every order, and we shared every item. I liked that I got to try so many things, but the bill really added up. It was about $300.00 when all was said and done (there were two tequila flights in there). So, while on the surface things may seem cheap, the dishes are very small and you have to order at least 2 per person to feel full.", "date": "2015-03-02 14:56:23"}

I was reminded of that last night as I dined for their special \"Lamb Shack\" promotion. \n\nIn short, the Lamb Shack special was offered in February 2015. It consisted of a prix fixe menu starting with hummus and pita & salatim as an appetizer, their signature lamb shoulder as the main and dessert for $36. Plus, you can BYOB at no charge during this promotion. \n\nWords cannot describe how amazing the lamb shoulder was. It was slow cooked with pomegranate juice and chickpeas and just phenomenal. It was served with a knife however the lamb was so fall-off-the-bone and so ridiculously tender that no knife was needed. Hands down the best lamb I've ever had and possibly one of the best things I've ever eaten.\n\nI can't forget to mention the appetizers and dessert. I've dined at Zahav before so was familiar with the amazingness that is their salatim. Yesterday's dinner came with the twice-cooked eggplant, beets with tehina, Moroccan carrots, Tabbouleh, Cucumber Persimmon and cabbage with sumac onions. I won't go into detail about these six small plates but will say two words: Flavor Burst. \n\nIt also came with a large portion of hummus and pita so hot it steamed. Needless to say, it was some of the best pita and hummus I've ever had. \n\nThe dessert was the Chocolate Konafi. It was certainly different than anything I've had before and once I reached the chocolate ganache in the center absolutely hit the spot. \n\nI believe the lamb shoulder is typically available if you call ahead with a part of nine or more. It's worth it and I'm so thrilled to have been able to try it without the stipulations. I'm also thrilled that it was so huge and that leftovers are waiting for me at home. \n\nThe service was professional and attentive. There were two seating's of the evening and it just felt slightly rushed. On another note, I heard one server tell a nearby table that they are doing some renovations in the main dining room/kitchen and that was one of the reasons for Lamb Shack. \n\nIn any case, my meal was outstanding and I can't wait to wait for my next visit to Zahav. It'll be hard for anything else to live up to that lamb, but if any restaurant can do it I'm sure Zahav can.", "date": "2015-02-17 19:31:55"}

Second day with clients in town and I thought this cool little spot would be a great place to show off some STL cue. Plus... all my favs for guests are all closed on Monday (Sydney Street, Niche, Terrene). I've been here a few times before and like it's quaint atmosphere. \n\nThey were out of everything liquid. My first two beer orders and my guests first wine order were not available. The waitress claimed that they get their liquor order on Tuesdays... which is fine, but I was amazed that they run out of so many things on a weekly basis. By the way, they were out of Diet Coke too. \n\nFrustrated, I just asked the waitress to bring out one of the draft beers that they did have. At this point I didn't care which. She brought out a vanilla porter. Yum. It was awesome. I'm glad I had her pick because I wouldn't have selected this and it was so good. My guests landed on a Pinot from Aquainas. It was ok... but they seemed pleased. \n\nWe started with the smoked wings, and smothered fries. Both were on special. I really like these wings. They're some of my favorites in town. They come out charred black with dipping sauce. They're meaty, smokey, and good. The fries are smothered in a white velveetaish sauce and bacon bits. We were starving after a long day of work and both hit the spot. \n\nService here sucked, actually. Don't get me wrong, our waitress wasn't screwing around, she simply was too busy. And due to her speeding around, she was super rushed at the table. We had trouble flagging her down to order dinner, and to request items like straws and extra napkins. I didn't really get it. There were two servers... but she had 8 or 9 tables while the other guy had one. Oh well... I hope this is an anomaly as I've experienced much better service here previously. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the Big Jimmy's sampler. It consists of ribs, chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. It was just average. I know better than to order BBQ late at night. It's always dry and looses that juicy, fall off the bone quality. Again, my guests were fine with it, but I couldn't help but think that I could make better cue at home. Again, as I said before, I'll be back because I like this place, but next time I'll steer away from the smoked meat entrees. \n\nWe loaded up with a bunch of sides. We tried the Mac & Cheese, green bean casserole, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and the chili sampler. If you like butter and gooey cheese, you'll like this place. The mac & cheese, and creamed corn are so loaded with them that they start to harden after a few minutes. The sides were good. I liked the beans and duck chili (one of the 4 chili samplers) best. \n\nMy guest lefts super pleased... which was my goal by going here.

I was invited to Cuenelli's on Friday by the owner after running into her at the grocery store for a complimentary dinner for my food blog. I wasn't disappointed. I started with the Papa a la Huancaina ($5.99). Normally I skip appetizers at restaurants and dive right into my meal, but this appetizer is hard to resist. The eggs and potatoes go well with the spicy yellow sauce. Normally my friend and I destroy it while we wait for dinner (which normally comes pretty quick at this restaurant).\n\nThe tough decision one always makes at Cuenelli's is: chicken or steak? Both are excellent and have their own, unique taste. My friend and I, being the smart two university students we are decided to order both and then mix and match. The chicken sandwich ($6.99) being well worth the cost. If Cuenelli's sandwiches were available to me -  I would certainly want one every week because they are just that good. I searched the streets of Seoul looking for some decent Peruvian food for four months without anything hinting to some of the great Spanish cuisine we have here in Florida.\n\nThe Bistec a lo Pobre ($11.99) was a delicious treat as well. The over-easy egg yolk went excellent with the rice, beans, and plantains. Cuenelli's homemade french fries are always a great hit to have on the side. \n\nThe last entree we had was the Peruvian ceviche which was both spicy and tangy. It hit the right palate and was enjoyable. Packed in my favorite vegetable: onions. The pumpkin and corn on the side was a nice addition and it was my first time trying this dish. I consider ceviche to be more of an appetizer than an entree, but this portion was certainly an entree size.\n\nOverall, great food is still to be had at Cuenelli's. If you haven't tried this Peruvian restaurant, you owe it to yourself to take some time and drive down Hillsborough for some delicious Peruvian cuisine.", "date": "2012-04-17 06:10:35"}

There is a lunch menu which leans heavily on their Chinese fare... but you have to ask for it.  Do it... the value is good... a decent sized dish with appetizer and soup for around 10 bucks.  I've come here countless times and had no clue they had a lunch menu until I brought my father and he inquired.  \n\nThis past time I tried an appetizer of Cha Gio Tom (mini shrimp egg rolls).

Modern d\u00e9cor is showcased through the interior and exterior of Ulele. An intricate cogs-and-wheels front door made by Dominique Martinez of Rustic Steel Creations greets diners at the entrance of the brick building. Inside you'll find furniture made from reclaimed Florida wood, an open 10-foot barbacoa kitchen, a glass wine cellar, and an on-site brewery.\n\nMy husband and I booked a 7pm reservation on OpenTable for Ulele on October 18th. Our table wasn't quite ready for us at our requested time so we took the opportunity to explore the riverwalk and park. Once our table was ready we were led upstairs on the floating staircase and were treated to tranquil waterfront views of the Hillsborough River. \n\nThe liquor menu included handcrafted beers from Ulele's brewery, signature cocktails, and domestic wines from family-owned vineyards. The wines range from affordable bottles under $30 to more impressive wines, such as the Opus One at a bank breaking price tag of $188. We opted for a red blend, \"Baby Blue\" from Blue Rock Vineyard in Sonoma, Alexander Valley. The wine was very unique and I would definitely order it again.\n\nWe started off our meal with the Ulele side salad with mixed greens, arugula, watercress, baby Swiss cheese, cranberry beans, fire-roasted peppers, onions, and a balsamic vinaigrette and the Florida Native Chili with alligator, wild boar, venison, duck, ground chuck, and cranberry beans. The salad was light and refreshing. My husband's chili was delicious, but very hearty so he was almost full before our meals arrived.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the Seafood Risotto special of the evening. This dish contained generous portions of lobster tails, crab claws, scallops and shrimp. My husband ordered the Flank Steak with a Florida avocado \"Jimmychurri\". This dish sounded great on the menu, but we both agreed it fell a bit flat. The steak was too chewy and the Jimmychurri sauce was bland. We also didn't understand why popcorn was on top of the mashed potatoes. It didn't add any flavor or texture to the potatoes. \n\nUnfortunately we didn't save room for dessert, but the Candied Duck Bacon Maple Fried Ice Cream sounded amazing!", "date": "2014-10-31 20:21:50"}

Luckily, there is a long communal table that is first come first serve, so I didn't have to sit outside (which is also first come first serve) or wait the thirty minutes. \n\nMy friend and I both went with the flight of four beers, deciding to share. This means we got to try a total of eight beers. We're dark beer drinkers, so this means we tried every porter/stout/brown ale they had on their menu (and then had to pull a couple non-dark beers to hit our eight). Honestly, I enjoyed them all. Some of the beers are seasonal and tbh, when I do beer flights unless the beer name is written down in front of me, I can't keep them straight. You'll have to come and try them yourself.\n\nI got the Beer B Q Turkey Burger. Maybe this is my fault, since it is in the name, but I wasn't a fan of the beer b q sauce. I found it overwhelming. It also came with fried jalapenos which I picked out (I am not a spice person). The bun was perfectly buttered. I honestly planned to just pick at the bun, but I ate the whole thing!

Although the dish was good, the quesadilla seemed a little mediocre compared to the rest of the items on her combination plate.  I had the Chili Relleno and it was the best relleno I've ever had.

Plus the scallops were perfect cooked.  Dessert was a choice of mini-indulgences, and I went with the pecan pie option of vanilla bean mousse, whipped cream, and honey-glazed pecan.  Yum!  The perfect light dessert after a filling meal.\n\nAll in all a great experience especially since I did not leave hungry, and I would definitely return.", "date": "2019-03-20 12:04:59"}

Like pick your jaw up off the tiled floor and quit drooling kinda WOW!!!!  Oxford Exchange is an absolutely amazing experience, and kicks off a breathtaking new trend for the Tampa Bay area.\n\nOxford Exchange is located along Kennedy Boulevard, directly across the street from the University of Tampa campus, and just down the block from the Tampa Theater. To get there, I would recommend driving along Kennedy and then turning south at the traffic light onto S. Hyde Park Avenue (directly opposite the UT front gates), and then turning right onto Grand Central Avenue. From there you can look for FREE on-street parking, or park across the street in the church parking lot. Oxford Exchange shares the block with the Tampa Theater, Mis En Place, and some kind of punch-your-lights-out boxing / gym thing.\n\nOxford Exchange is a refurbished 100 year-old brick building that now houses an incredible multi-use retail facility. If you park around back, then you enter the building through the intimate and eclectic bookstore. The tiled floor in this area is spectacular, and worthy of careful study before you move along. The bookstore is a collection of classic and rare books which are arranged not in the typical \"mystery\", \"romance\", \"non-fiction\" categories, but rather by themes such as Discovery, Solace, and \"What Would Happen if Abraham Lincoln Had Lived\". These books are more the hardback, collectible, and home library style. Really a beautiful spot, and I can imagine myself spending an hour or so pouring over their collection.\n\nContinuing through the bookstore you meander down a long hallway which is paneled in dark wood, and move into the atrium which is a two-story gathering spot with a dramatic black and white tiled floor, high arched white ceiling and comfortable leather sofas, antique overstuffed chairs, and small tables. In this section of the complex you'll find a Buddy Brew fine coffee establishment and TeBella's boutique tea house. The idea being that you can buy your favorite non-alcoholic drink and visit with friends in a very posh conversation area. The walls in the atrium are covered with vintage photos and artwork.\n\nLeading up the stairs in this central atrium area is the private \"Commerce Club\", where members can relax, read and work in a very classy, quiet, private office space. The lady I spoke with said that talking on cellphones is discouraged within the Commerce Club, and so if you need to make a call they will direct you to a private, leather-padded booth so as not to disturb those around you. (Hear, Hear!!!)\n\nBack downstairs and out through the tall glass doors, and you enter the solarium with it's two-story glass-ceiling with white-painted brick walls and tables for eating or reading. The solarium plays host to the daily High Tea, served from 3 - 5pm, complete with a proper English tea service, finger sandwiches, scones, and sweets.\n\nMoving back into the atrium and walking through the doorway towards Kennedy Boulevard, you enter the home-design retail shop with its collection of aromatherapy candles, cookbooks, spices, scents, fine stationary, quality gifts, and so much more. This is also the waiting area for the Oxford Exchange restaurant, and so the crowd wanders around the floor, delighted by these treasures as they wait for their table. My Dad would refer to this as a Cracker Barrel Store for grown-ups, with no noisy PA system!\n\nAfter a good half-hour of walking around with a bad case of my eyes bugging out of my head at all of this splendor, I finally made it to the hostess stand of the Oxford Exchange Restaurant. Even though there is seating for about 100 people, the restaurant was plenty full. The lady offered for me to wait about 20 minutes, or they could seat me right away at the Chef's Table / Bar overlooking the open-air kitchen. Yes please!!!!!\n\nThe restaurant has polished marble floors, white-painted brick walls, metallic tabletops, and a vibrant \"buzz\" of activity and excitement. It's hard to believe that the Oxford Exchange has only been open since September, but the place was packed with a mixture of college students (and their parents), well-dressed downtown workers, and those of us who's jaws were still dragging on the floor.\n\nI started my meal with a pot of Yuzu Oolong tea (scented with grapefruit for a very crisp and clean taste). I heard nice things about the Tuna Tar Tar, and ordered that for my appetizer. The diced tuna was served with avocado, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, crispy potato slices, and thin slivers of jalapeno peppers, all piled high into a dramatic little tower and plated with a light soy-based sauce. YUM!\n\nFor my main course I ordered the Wild Salmon Nicoise salad which was a nice 8 ounce filet of grilled and seasoned salmon, sitting atop a bed of Bibb lettuce with green beans, a quartered hard-boiled egg, Nicoise olives, thin-sliced potatoes, and dressed with a light Dijon vinaigrette.\n\n(Part two to follow).....", "date": "2013-01-02 22:30:54"}

The only thing better than eating dinner, having a beer and looking at pups would be if they had live dogs in the restaurant. I understand why that unfortunately cannot happen.\n\nOn my past visits I've always gotten the burger. I'm sure you've also heard how great their burger is. I wasn't in the mood yesterday and was feeling a little adventurous so went with the Lamb Meatball sandwich.\n\nIt was an excellent choice and I'm glad I ventured out of my comfort zone. It was prepared with cucumber, tomato & red onion salad, tzatziki mayo on a rustic French roll. There were about 4-6 medium sized meatballs that weren't overly seasoned so you could really enjoy the taste of the lamb. The tomato and red onion salad combined with the tzatziki did a great job of adding a little moistness to the sandwich. I know the fries are awesome, but I was trying to be good and opted for the vegetables. It's an even swap with no upcharge, which I always appreciate. The veggie of the day was bourbon glazed carrots. OH MY GAWD!  They were amazing and I could have had an entire dish of them. They were cooked to a perfect not too soft but not too hard state and the glaze tasted like cinnamon. I'd say I was happy with my choices for the evening.\n\nOur server was everything we could have asked for at a pub type establishment. He was on top of his game, courteous and not overbearing.\n\nNot feeling too adventurous with beer, I opted for the Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA. Sometimes a classic is just nice. \n\nGood Dog is a Philadelphia classic establishments which I wish I didn't overlook so frequently on the hunt for new and trendy. Good Dog.

Let me start by saying, I would always recommend  making a reservation. This has been the standard for many years, but the last few years, I have seen people walk in and be seated fairly promptly without reservations. Another thing is customers used to always make an effort to dress up a bit, before dining  at this fine establishment. Now it is not unusual to see jeans & sneakers.\nThe above statements make me wonder, if the residents  of Tampa are being  complacent  or taking this superb eatery for granted? I certainly  hope we have better manners than to take this restaurant for granted.\nThere are various  rooms to the restaurant,  each unique, while maintaining the heavy & rich distinctive  decore, that does have a high class underlying  brothel feel to it, in a very good way. All of these rooms are not created equal & my personal favorite is the 2nd one on the left. It seems to be quieter, more room between the tables & it fits my personal tastes. Even their restrooms are ornate and upscale.\nMy rule of thumb when ordering steak, is to order it with several people, so you get a nice large, thick cut of meat. It used to be all od the sides were ala cart, but now the piping hot, cheesey onion soup, warm bread, fresh veggie, freh ( grown by establishment ) salad & potatoes or rice come with the meal. I love escargot  & their's  is spot on, so I usually begin my meal with the snails.\nBern's was locally sourced and field to table, long before it became fashionable. Never forget their tours of the kitchen, garden, desert  room & wine room, a must for any neubie & occasionally again as the years go by.\nA visit to the second floor dessert  room is always a treat after dinner or on its own. Don't Fogel the great steak sandwich served in the bar. The bar is as ornate as the restaurant  and at times a very pleasant  refuge from the bustle of your fellow dinners. The sandwich is substantial & just downright  good eats. They also have burgers available in the dining rooms  and bar. You can usually  kind of make your own burger, by selecting your favorite toppings. These burgers are not for the faint of heart and are very substantial, juicy & delicious. \nI will mention the wine & service in passing, as I did the Desert  Room. The reason for this, it would take 3 more pages to give them their proper acknowledgements.  Suffice it to say from start to finish, this is a most memorable dining experience and one you will not soon forget.\nYou can depend on excellent  service, without them hovering  over your table.\nWhat's  a  girl  to  do?  I still make reservations & dress for the occasion, I could never take Bern's  for granted.", "date": "2015-02-21 23:50:36"}

The mix of jalape\u00f1o, radishes, basil, and the syrup (black garlic) came together well.  The sizing was appropriate for the price as well.\n\nOur mains were both letdowns.  The Seared Sea Scallops came with 4 nice sized scallops which is a fair portion. They weren't very good lukewarm and seemed to be a bit over seared. The Tuscan Sangiovese Glazed Beef Short Rib, also lukewarm at best at this point, was not at all tender.  The flavor profile was there, but being chewy just isn't what I was expecting.\n\nYes, it is COIVD times.  Yes, it is take out. Still, keep in mind this restaurant is high end and we paid a premium for what we felt would be a stellar dining experience. I've been inside on one or two other occasions and cannot believe the night and day change in experience.", "date": "2020-10-17 22:58:48"}

The main room is filled with tables inches apart, which is great for large parties, but a little loud for people who want to have easy conversation. Try and get a booth; better yet, try and get a booth in the quieter back room.\n\nThe servers are all males, and they speed about the restaurant, yet I feel like they are never around when I actually need them to take our order, get a drink refill, or get the check. This last visit, the waiter completely forgot our appetizer order (even though I watched him write it down), so when we got our dinner we had to tell him to cancel it.\n\nFood was good, with huge portions, and almost everybody will have leftover dinner to take home. Spanish bean soup was fine, but it didn't have a very rich flavor - the flavors definitely needed to blend more together, plus the broth was very thin. The picadillo was okay, but needed more seasoning-it was pretty bland until I added some hot sauce. I was disappointed that they don't have the Cuban staple, ropa vieja, on the menu every night. Bread comes with every meal, and it was the flattest, most tasteless Cuban bread I've ever eaten.\n\nFortunately, the tres leches cake for dessert was delicious, even though it didn't look like their dessert menu picture with sauce on the bottom.

I hadn't been there in a few years but used to really like it. I made it in on a weeknight in February by myself. I opted for a glass of water and ate a couple of chips with salsa while I looked over the menu. Their chips, to me, are perfect. Just the right thickness and amount of salt. The salsa is good but I like just a little bit more heat. I decided on the Guacamole appetizer and the Shrimp & Grits (Jumbo shrimp saut\u00e9ed in a fiery chile de arbol sauce, served with green chile goat cheese grits and street corn \"off the cob\") entr\u00e9e. The guacamole was good and I liked the sprinkling of queso fresco on top but I thought it could have used a touch of salt and little more lime than just the wedge that came on the plate. My entr\u00e9e, the Shrimp & Grits, was really enjoyable. I loved the mild heat of the chile de arbol sauce and the subtle goat cheese flavor of the grits. It could have been overwhelming but it wasn't. Of course everyone loves the Tilford street corn. It's good. I ate every single bite of food on the plate! I'd rate this food at a solid 4.5 but the service I received was about a 2. I don't think I've ever called out a server by name in a review but Anna could not have cared less to wait on me. I never got a water refill, she never asked if I enjoyed my food, wanted anything else, etc. I think the table I ate at had more personality. My only other comment would be that this is a terrible location and the crowd was most definitely older. I hope they do find a new location, make some staffing changes, and breathe new life into the concept because this food is still really good.

This seems a little strange...but I'll give it a try. I guess since I fly into Tampa at least 3 or 4 times a year it is only fair I share some of information about this airport. \nArrivals-this is a crazy busy section! The attendants seriously will yell at you and blow their whistles if you are parked for more than 10 seconds without movement. They take their job very seriously and unless you are \"loading\" a new passenger from the pick-up you are not allowed to loiter. They do have an awesome cell-phone waiting lot though with a giant screen to display all the flight information. It's actually not too bad when you go to pick up someone. \nDepartures-I can honestly say that every time I get dropped off at the airport it is very simple to find a spot to unload and check-in my bags. I don't thinks this area is ever too busy. \nSecurity-what can I say about security? It's necessary so I just deal with it. In order to get to the screenings though you have to board a tram! This is my favorite part because I love riding trams at airports! I know, I'm a dork! Take the tram to the security area. Then be prepared to wait at least a few minutes before being screened. The security there isn't too terrible. They do a good job. \nOther than that, the airport is clean and the terminals all have lots to do. My favorite part is grabbing some drinks before a flight. Usually I am sad when I am at this airport because I typically have to say bye to my family...so I have a drink or two and then I feel better. \nFor an airport this place is quick and safe.

Ulele.\n\nFor those who don't know, Ulele Restaurant is named after Princess Ulele, the young daughter of the chief of the west Florida Tocobaga Indian tribe. In a story that seems eerily familiar, Princess Ulele threw herself over the Spanish explorer, Juan Ortiz, moments before he was about to be roasted alive. The Pocahontas - John Smith legend happened 80 years later. Hmmmmmm...\n\nA group of local Yelpers gathered at Ulele about a week ago to enjoy a spectacular meal, and to say Bon Voyage to one of our favorite friends. Eric C has taken a two-year internship in Providence, Rhode Island and so we wanted to send him out in style. With a bit of cunning and deception, we all gathered at the bar at Ulele ahead of time before Eric & Robbie's arrival. The plan was to surprise them, and then all enjoy a wonderful dinner.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a refurbished two-story warehouse along the Hillsborough River just north of the Performing Arts Center and Waterworks Park. The weathered brick exterior combined with the modern metal works sculptures is the perfect juxtaposition for this fine dining establishment. Something old - something new - and something WOW! Through the front doors and to your right is the open-air grill and a beautiful bar area displaying colorful bottles and Ulele's house-brewed beers on tap. Keep an eye on the walls for some gorgeous modern artwork and stained glass windows.\n\nWhile we were waiting for Robbie & Eric to arrive, Head Brewmaster Tim Shackton gave us a tour of the on-site microbrewery, and shared some secrets with us about the delicious Adult beverages that are produced back in his brew palace. Order the Wedding Beer!!!\n\nThe hostess snuck our group through the back patio and in through the open doors that face the Hillsborough River. Our group hid our faces behind our menus until Eric rounded the corner, and then it was time to yell \"SURPRISE!\" and have some fun.\n\nAmid all of the laughter we ordered some very fabulous dishes off their unique menu. The food is an interesting mix of locally-sourced ingredients with Gulf Coast seafood, fresh-from-Florida Beef, fowl, pork, and vegetarian options. I started with a dozen charbroiled oysters and a dash of their homemade hot sauce, and shared my oysters with several people. Others ordered crab mac & cheese, pulpo carpaccio (shaved octopus in a spicy piri piri sauce), okra fries, Florida native chili (alligator, wild boar, vension, and duck), and a wide variety of house special salads.\n\nI added the half-sized Ulele salad, which was mixed greens, arugula, and watercress with baby Swiss, cranberry beans, fire-roasted peppers, onions, and a warm balsamic vinaigrette. Excellent choice as a light precursor to a delicious dinner!\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I selected one of the specials for the evening which was a dry-aged, 14-ounce NY strip steak topped with saut\u00e9ed shrimp, and served over Ulele's white cheddar mashed potatoes topped with popcorn & roasted garlic. That came with a side of perfectly cooked string beans. (I confess that half of my dinner came home with me for the next night).\n\nI should pause here to give credit to our servers Sydney and Rodney. Both were extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the food preparation, and they did a fabulous job keeping up with everyone's drink orders and special requests. They remembered what each of us had ordered and helped make some very useful suggestions about pairing entrees with appetizers and so on. Two thumbs up for you guys! \n\nBy now we had bestowed our gag gifts upon Eric including a palm tree tiara, palm tree table centerpiece, woolen hat and scarf, and a tastefully tacky Hawaiian shirt. (Be sure to check out the photos.)\n\nIt was finally time for dessert, and wow the choices were fantastic. I ordered a basic dish of their homemade very berry ice cream which arrived at the table as two scoops served inside of a hollowed-out coconut shell. Very whimsical and extremely tasty.\n\nOur surprise dinner for Eric was a huge success, and the folks at Ulele treated us to some incredibly delicious food and home-brewed beers, and then dazzled us with their creative architecture and spot-on customer service. Thank you to Ulele for an amazing evening, and thank you for giving me the perfect spot to honor with my 1000th Yelp review!", "date": "2014-10-12 19:28:42"}

He did put tbe bacon in the oven and put a few pieces in the deep fryer so she got her bacon and in turn we got ours. The young ladies up front were very disorganized.

I could watch them for hours as they seemed amazed by all the human visitors they had that day.  \n\nIt was very educational for me as well to see all the different fish species and the bios that were posted by each tank.  Despite it only taking a couple of hours to go through the whole aquarium, it was a very enlightening experience for me and to see something unique that Tampa offers.", "date": "2014-05-27 01:11:05"}

WOW!\n\nThat's all you would need to say to a die-hard 4Rivers fanatic, and that would earn you a fist bump and nod of respect.  However since most of us have not yet sampled Brett's favorite culinary mecca of smoked meat yumminess, let me elaborate for the uninitiated. \n\n4Rivers is a chain of BBQ smokehouse restaurants which started in Winter Park, FL under the control of Pitmaster extraordinaire John Rivers. John spent 20 years in the healthcare industry before retiring as president of a billion-dollar company. During that time, he had the opportunity to travel the country, honing his taste and talent for brisket perfection. \n\n4 Rivers Smokehouse began with the launch of the \"Barbecue Ministry\" in 2004, when John hosted a cookout fundraiser to support a local family whose young daughter was battling cancer. This one event resulted in a passion for supporting local schools, churches, and charitable organizations. He opened his first smokehouse restaurant in 2009 and has been slowly expanding his empire since then. This newest 4Rivers location in Tampa opened today at 11am, and I was one of the first people through the doors for the Saturday lunch rush.\n\nAccording to a story in yesterday's Tampa Bay Business Journal, the 4Rivers crew started prepping and smoking 960 pounds of brisket last night. (Yup, that is nearly half a ton of moo cow!) They were also smoking nearly 500 pounds of pork, and major amounts of chicken, sausage, turkey, ribs and more for the grand opening celebration. Justin Clermont is the General Manager of the new Carrollwood location, and he was walking through the dining room and shaking hands with everyone as we were happily munching away on the smoked meat goodness.\n\nYou walk through the front doors and snake your way up to the front counter where the guys will take your \"meat\" order. Beef brisket is the king, along with pulled pork, burnt ends, sliced pork, smokehouse turkey, Texas sausage, smoked chicken, ribs, and wings. Your food is placed on a metal tray covered with a piece of butcher's paper. You can also order sandwiches and salads.\n\nYour tray is slid over to the ladies scooping up the sides, and you have your choice of cornbread salad, fried pickles, mac n cheese, baked cheese grits, BBQ beans, potato salad, Smokehouse corn, Southern-style green beans, French fries, coleslaw, fried okra, collard greens, bread pudding, sweet potato casserole, smoked jalapenos, and your choice of cornbread or a biscuit.\n\nFrom there your tray is slid to the cashier where you can add on drinks, bottles of sauce, homemade seasonings, and gift cards. You gather up your metal tray and then walk past the Sweet Shop  where you'll be taunted by cupcakes, \"cake bombs\", wedge o' cake, fried Oreos, pudding cups, and Kolache which is a type of pastry that holds a dollop of fruit rimmed by a puffy pillow of dough. \n\nAssuming that you make it past the Sweet Spot without dropping into a frothing diabetic coma, you then wander towards the back of the dining room to collect your plasticware and fill your fountain drink cups. Then it's out to the main dining area where the long tables are set out to encourage Texas-style family dining. Don't plan on an intimate little 4-top dinner. You'll have neighbors to your right and to your left, whether you like it or not.\n\nThe 4Rivers staff was constantly circling the dining area to say hi to everyone, refill drinks, bring over to-go containers, and answer questions. They stopped to tell us about the Pitmaster loyalty program where you can earn points and free treats for being a frequent diner at 4Rivers.\n\nFor lunch I ordered a plate of their legendary brisket, and the guys gave me a generous taste of burnt ends on the same platter. That came with three sides, and I selected fried okra, mac n cheese, and baked cheese grits. And the whole meal came with either a biscuit or cornbread. I highly recommend the cornbread!\n\nThe brisket was juicy and tender, and the homemade sauce was a perfect complement. 4Rivers has other homemade BBQ sauces, pepper sauces, and pepper vinegar out on the table. Very yummy meal, and well-worth a visit!", "date": "2014-12-13 17:44:32"}

First, I must mention that had Charles not written his review, or explained to me that this is more than just a dive bar, I would have never been back here except during the block party. Now that I have, I can guarantee I will be back.\n\nThe restaurant at Parasol's is located atop the bar area. Enter from the outside if you're special, or be like me and enter through the bar.

The way the pork, slaw and onion flavors merged together made me literally exclaim \"wow\" after each bite. \n\nThe only reason I went with four stars instead of five was the speed of service.

One everyone must try! It's a no thrills take out only joint with a few tables out front. You'll be given a taste of that South Philly hospitality/'tude, and definitely a hearty dose of that unmistakable accent.\n\nI remember coming here when I was just a little girl with my parents. We drove all the way down to the city just for these sammies! I of course as a young vegetarian was ordering broccoli rabe with a nice thick slice of perfectly sharp provolone and the 'rents would always go for the Chicken or Pork 'Italiano'. Both served on crispy Liscio's rolls which are baked fresh daily and thick enough to hold the generous amount of food stuffed into them. We would all split an order of cheese drenched fries and all leave totally satisfied. Worth the trek. \n\nOver the years I progressed to a vegan and really had no reason to go to Tony Luke's. Until last night that's is....I was with the extended fam bowling down the street. After a few pitchers of brews they were craving cheesesteaks to cap the night off. My brother informed me the menu over here now has a sammy called 'Uncle Mike' which is sweet and hot peppers, broccoli and spinach rabe (cooked in oil not butter), saut\u00e9ed onion and red \"gravy\" which for those not from the area, that's tomato sauce. I made sure to ask for no cheese but it wasn't listed on the menu. The rabe was just as I had remembered it!! Tony Luke's hands down makes the best broccoli rabe in all of South Philly! Trust me, I've tasted my fair share. It's not bitter as it can sometimes be and it's not too oily. It's perfect. I ordered the 'Uncle Mike' with the \"gravy\" on the side thinking it may make it too mushy. Dipping was the way to go I believe. The sammy had a real nice kick from the peppers but the sauce cooled my mouth down. Perfect combo! I even had half leftover for lunch the next day! It was a big boy! The roll still wasn't soggy even then! Win! I will definitely be back for this bad boy again soon. This actually may not be the best discovery, but it's certainly nice to have a veg option when the fam wants steaks now!\n\nTony Luke's offers so much more than cheesesteaks. I guarantee there's something here for any craving you may have! \n\nTheir meat is hormone and antibiotic free. Their veggies are grown in South Jersey and prepared in the Luke family's commissary in the city. I love that local love! Each sandwich and food item is cooked to order and takes the appropriate amount of time. Be patient. There will always be a wait on game day and especially after a home game of any kind. Fun atmosphere though. Well, if we win that is :) \n\n\"Luke\" is a pretty interesting guy which makes me like his joint even more. Check out their website for his whole story. Way too much to tell! In short, he's a CAPA grad who has produced music and films, acted in movies, and created and hosts the web series \"Food Mashups\". He has also been on many Food Network Tv shows such as \"Throw-down With Bobby Flay\". I always like a good Philly born and bred success story especially when folks stay true to their roots. Nice! \n\n*They now sell their sliced rib-eye at Acme for those interested in making sammies at home.", "date": "2017-03-29 02:42:57"}

Known for their roast pork, the business began serving cheesesteaks in the 1960s. John's is the James Beard Award-winning gold standard for the non-tourist cheesesteak. The secret to their success is simple, high quality ingredients. \n\nThe elements of a John's Roast Pork award winning cheesesteak includes a half-loaf of freshly baked Carangi Bakery sesame seeded Italian bread, 12 ounces of thinly sliced tenderloin beef steak, sharp provolone cheese, and saut\u00e9ed sweet spanish onions. After one bite of this glorious cheesesteak I was in heaven! Every bite was cheesy and beefy. The center of the bread is gutted (removed) to accommodate the generous amounts of beef, resulting in the perfect bread to meat ratio. I added some spicy peppers to the sandwich for a little heat. The juicy beef quickly saturates the bread so you'll want to dine on the picnic tables outside so you can devour this sandwich immediately.\n\nYou'll get some strange looks if you ask for your cheesesteak \"wid wiz\". Owner, John Bucci Jr., will never use Cheez Whiz in the John's Roast Pork cheesesteak because he believes it is gross, fake cheese. Instead, Bucci offers customers a choice of American, mild provolone, and sharp provolone. \n\nNext time I visit I'll have to try the roast pork sandwich although it will be hard to not order the cheesesteak. Maybe I'll order both?\n\nTIP: Cash only! ATM available onsite.", "date": "2015-03-29 17:14:18"}

The only thing I would have preffered would have been is that the slaw wasn't confetti cut. I like the texture of cabbage, and when it's cut so tiny, you lose that and sadly, a lot of the flavour. \n\nThe biggest drawback is how loud it is inside. It's almost headache inducing.

Each area is so much fun with the wine, the cheese, the coffee bar, the desserts, the deli, all of the different foods.\nThere is a huge array of food to order whether it's the 20 something sandwiches, and soup options, or whatever is in the pretty clear glass case. They serve it up warm for you if you want. The food in the case ranges from salads, to pastas, to seafood and chicken. Served up either individual style or by pound. To me, the pound thing can get kind of tricky, but they will weigh it for you, and let you know how much it costs.  Hold off on getting your ticket to make your order until you choose what you want to order. Just making a decision is a fun project in itself. Once you are ready, grab your number, and wait to be called. \nThe service working there are very nice and helpful, especially for the ones that are not versed on their system of ordering. Everything looks and tastes scrumptious, and I can not wait to be back. I can definitely bring friends and family here too so they can check out the goodness of Mazzaro's.", "date": "2014-05-20 23:38:37"}

Fellow yelper, Anna M., joined me for dinner and drinks at the bar. The crowd was pretty mellow before 6pm, but the bar and restaurant quickly got packed so call ahead for a table if you are dining during peak hours. We had another Yelper, Fabian, join us after 6pm and we had to hide a barstool until he arrived!\n\nThe d\u00e9cor at Bartaco is simply gorgeous. The wooden bar and booths and hanging baskets from the light fixtures gives the restaurant a relaxed beachy/west coast vibe. The cocktails are all handcrafted at Bartaco so you'll find the bar lined with a juice press and cocktail garnishes such as fresh thyme, limes, and watermelon wedges. Our bartender, Kate, was a total boss on the juice press and was whipping up cocktail concoctions all night!   \n\nThe tacos were so good and so innovative! We started off our meal with the homemade guac and chips. The small portion is enough for two, but I love guacamole so I'd probably order the large portion next time. I ordered the spicy chorizo taco, cauliflower taco, and duck taco. The freshly made corn tortillas on the tacos were to die for! All of the ingredients in the tacos were so fresh. The tacos are Cali-style so you won't find your Tex-Mex selection of shredded lettuce, cheese, and sour cream on the tacos. Anna ordered a side of crumbled Mexican Queso for the tacos. The queso was a nice touch on my spicy chorizo taco, but the duck and the cauliflower tacos were so flavorful that I didn't bother adding cheese. \n\nThe tacos at Bartaco are cheap, but tiny so you'll want to order at least three or four tacos (more if you're a guy). The cauliflower taco was too spicy for Anna so I had hers, but had she not given me her taco I would have ordered a fried oyster or the sesame ribeye taco. We split a side of the grilled corn with lime, cayenne pepper, and cotija cheese. Whoa, loved this side dish!!! We asked the kitchen to remove the corn from the cob for us so that we could eat the corn in a more ladylike fashion.\n\nHad I only ordered food last night my bill would have been under $15, but Anna and I were on a mission to sample every cocktail on the menu. The damage wasn't as bad as I would have thought for the four cocktails I had (~$35). I tried the \"Bartaco Margarita\" (my favorite cocktail of the night), the \"Humo y Fuego\" with sombra mezcal, muddled tomatillo, and jalapeno (packs a nice spicy punch!), the \"Sashito\" with Combier Liqueur d'Orange and a fresh watermelon garnish (perfect summer cocktail!), and the \"Clarico\" (similar to sangria).\n\nA slightly more economical option would have been to order a carafe of margaritas or mojitos, but we were already on our third cocktail of the night when we considered that option. A carafe holds six cocktails and ranges from $43-$48.\n\nI will definitely be back soon to try more of the menu and consume more of the amazing fresh guacamole at Bartaco!", "date": "2015-08-20 15:37:16"}

Except achieving a badge on Yelp is a lot more fun. I can not tell you how many Margarita's I have drunk or the number of tacos and burritos I've eaten to earn my Mexi-can badge.  I thought it was never going to happen. Then the other night while attending an International Supper Club gathering at Milagro, it did. Making it the most memorable badge I've earned. I was at my \"favorite\" Mexican restaurant and with 11 of my closest Yelp comrades.\n\nI always feel like I need to go to confession after having a Margarita at Milagro, because they are sinfully good. The \"featured\" Margarita was Mango-Pear, which went down rather smooth. So smooth, that I had to have more then one and would of had more if I did not have to get up at 4AM for work. Still I am fairly certain I'll be doing several Hail Mary's for what I did consume. \n\nAs an appetizer I shared Chorizo & Roasted Pablano Chili Queso Fundido with the SO. Their house made tortillas were perfect for dipping in and filling with the flavorful Queso. We both ordered the same entree which is unusual for us, but the Tacos en Cazuela just sounded to tempting. For me these were the perfect tacos to eat after earning my badge. The portions were huge, leaving me a little of each meat along with some Charro beans and street corn for the next day at work. I may not of had one of the corn tortillas left, but I still made my coworkers jealous at lunchtime. \n\nPraise Jesus for Milagro's Street Corn. If is not only off the cob, but off the charts in flavor as well. Friends have always said, that certain foods were their \"crack\" and I've never understood that phrase, but I do now. This street corn is so good that if need be, I'd work the \"street(s)\" to be able to have more. \n\nIt is always a team effort at Milagro to make sure your dining experience is top notch.  Their kitchen staff is willing to accommodate special dietary needs when possible and the wait staff has a \"no problem\" attitude when it comes to separating checks on a large party. \n\nIf you haven't been to Milagro, stop reading now and go.

Before, I used to always get something different when I visited someplace I've been because I wanted to try something new - I was always determined to see if there was something better. Now, when I find something I love, I tend to stick with it. It's the whole why fix something that isn't broken adage. \n\nI've always loved the brisket at 4 Rivers. I've only gone to the one in South Tampa, but I figured it would be the same. My husband mentioned his coworker got the Brontosaurus beef rib and loved it. I struggled internally with whether I wanted to try that instead, if it was bad my day would have been ruined because I could have gotten the brisket. I tried to convince my husband to get the brisket, but he wouldn't budge from his standard chicken sandwich. I slept on it, I thought about it some more, and then I decided I would do it. (Yes, this is what takes up most of my brainpower).\n\nI've tried the Brontosaurus Beef Rib and I can't go back. (Although, since it is $25+ my husband warned me this can't become an every day thing. Thanks, hon). First of all, it is huge! I was pregnant and did a spin class that morning so I was starved and I could only finish half. I ate an additional quarter for snack a couple hours later. Moral of the story is two people could easily share this bone of meat. I'm a huge lover of salty, fatty meat, and this satisfied those two cravings. There is so much salt and so much fat that I was in heaven. However, if you do not like salt or fat (or an overabundance of salt or fat), this is not the meat for you. My husband, who likes lean meat, would probably only eat half the meat. \n\nFor sides, I got the cole slaw and corn. I asked which vegetables don't contain pork and, unfortunately, both the green beans and the collard greens are made with pig. I can live with that because I loved the corn and cole slaw. They were the perfect accompaniments to my hunk of meat. I think the corn is cooked with onions so it gave it a richer flavor than just corn. \n\nThis location is so much bigger than the one in South Tampa. They have a huge dessert section, which I will have to check out another day when I'm not filled with meat. We got there at 11:30 on a Friday and there was no line. My husband got his chicken sandwich right away and it was about a ten-minute wait for my Brontosaurus Beef Rib. Basically, we were in and out in twenty minutes. \n\nI'm glad we don't live closer or else I would weigh 20 lbs more. I will be back for another Brontosaurus Beef Rib.", "date": "2018-11-21 14:17:29"}

I live in Seminole Heights and was unaware of the growth in the area of places like Ella's.  It's the type of establishment I would expect to come across in Ybor, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it in my back yard of the good ole' S.H.\n\nI sat at the bar with my roommate and ordered a shrimp wrap.  It came out on an ingredient by ingredient basis.  There was the wraps, the shrimp, fried yams, some veggies and a typical sauce you'd find in a Po Boy.  This was a phenomenal meal!  \n\nThe bad news?  The next time I came in, it had been taken off the menu.  WHY?!?!\n\nWe also shared some Chef's Hummus, which flavor changes constantly.  This particular visit to Ella's was around Halloween, so we were given Pumpkin flavored.  Again, a FIVE STAR dish.  But because the hummus changes so often, I haven't had the luck of coming across it again since my first visit.\n\nI've had the meat loaf.  It was good, but a bit on the rich side.  I felt like I ate a house after I was done.  The potato cakes that came with it were the best part of the meal.\n\nI've had the filet and was not a fan because of the amount of goat cheese piled on.  I compare goat cheese to the taste I'd imagine you would get from walking up to a live goat and biting it.

Unfortunately, I have had the same rangy 1-5 star experience on these days.\n\nThe go-to entree is Chicken and Waffles.  Sometime's it's been really great, sometimes it's been average.  The chicken physically looks different sometimes, which is never a good thing.\n\nI've gotten the KC BBQ Ribs and the Bayou Burger as well.  Both are ok.  The sweet potato fries are always pretty good.\n\nA couple of times we have gone to Ella's on a late Sunday afternoon and they have been out of 50-80% of the menu.  I understand the challenge of having different menu options for one day a week, but it's pretty ridiculous that if you don't beat the lunch crowd, you may not have the chance to enjoy your favorite Soul Food dish that day.\n\n\nOverall, despite the bad times at Ella's, I still recommend that everyone check it out.  The chance that you might be there on a good day makes it worth it.", "date": "2012-01-16 22:09:57"}

I had the shrimp ceviche with spicy tomato salsa on crispy plantain chips and the tortilla soup for the app. course.  The ceviche was refreshing with the perfect touch of spice; it went very well with the fried plantain.  A great summer option.  The tortilla soup was savory and creamy, thanks to the avocado, although it wasn't the best that I have ever had.  Still, it was very good.  I also tried the esquite, which was fantastic; it's like a creamy corn pudding of a sort.  The guacamole is also great, and I kinda wished that I had chosen that as one of my appetizers.  Oh well, more reason for me to come back and gorge myself silly.  For the \"entrees\", I decided on the mole amarillo and the huarache with bbq short ribs, both of which were solid.  The rabbit loin was tender and served casserole-style with pineapple and tomato, which gave the dish a nice refreshing shot; the loin itself was flavorful and tender.  I think that I still prefer my rabbit prepared Moroccan style with fresh apricots but this was still tasty and a great option if you are looking for something different.  The costilla huarache was absolutely delish with flavorful, tender short ribs and a savory, spicy, and sweet bbq sauce.  No, it's not for those on a low-carb diet but it's a must-try if you come here.  I would describe it as a flatbread, of a sort, but it is much better and more flavorful than the flatbreads at, say, Uno's, by far.  Dessert was flour less chocolate cake accompanied by caramel, peanuts, and chocolate ice cream.  It was good but I have high standards/benchmarks for my flour less chocolate cake (Finale in Harvard Square, anyone?) so I didn't find it to be outstanding.  Overall, this was a great introductory meal to Distrito for us and it definitely lived up to Jose Garces' reputation.  Will be back to try more of the menu but 4 stars for now.  Plus, service was flawless: friendly, helpful, and not overbearing.", "date": "2012-07-22 04:36:28"}

We had a table by the window overlooking Chestnut St and enjoyed the view while listening to Billy Joel classics.  My grilled shrimp salad was enormous and could easily feed 2, but it was mostly field greens with only a small scattering of toppings.  The corn, though, was freshly cut from the cob, which I did like, and the shrimp (all 5 of them) were nicely marinated and large.  The citrus honey vinaigrette actually went very well with the tortilla strips, but I did wish that there had been more avocado.  Overall, though, it was very solid.  The 1/2 lb burger was also solid, and you can substitute sweet potato fries for an extra $1, which I would highly recommend.  The sweet potato fries are well-cooked with a crispy shell and surprisingly symmetrical and uniform in length and width.  Service was pretty attentive and we did get our food in less than 10 minutes.  Plus, it is one of the few places still open for dinner at 9 pm on a Sunday!", "date": "2014-10-06 04:56:43"}

And it's dang delicious.\n\nWe all have friends visiting us in search of that illusive \"best po-boy.\" I pretty much go by what my trusted cronies on Yelp say because I don't eat roast beef, nor do I eat oysters either. I like Mahoney's, though they always have that line plus it takes 20 min or more to serve you. So unless I'm willing to kill an afternoon (which is never), it's not happening. I'm also a fan of Freret Street Po-Boys. But, I also wanted to try something new, so I brought my friend who was visiting and in dire need of a roast beef po-boy, to Parkway.\n\nThere's several options for seating: inside the bar, which is dim, charming and tavern-like as the name implies, in the brightly lit side room or on the patio. We picked the bar, as it was a particularly muggy and buggy night.\n\nThe bartender here was extremely nice and really went out of his way to make sure we had all that we needed (I had figured it'd be a serve yourself kind of operation). I was pretty thrilled to see a dedicated vegetarian section of the menu and although it's not exactly thrillsville in options, you never can go wrong with a Caprese sandwich, right? Vegans can get a plain ol lettuce and tomato sandwich which makes me really glad I'm not vegan anymore, just sayin'. I think there is a French fry one, too and that's about it. I was just happy to see that I didn't have only one (fried) option!\n\nThe sandwich can be ordered in small (6 inches) or large (12 inches). I ordered a large, figuring I'd eat the other half for lunch the next day. I advise that you don't do this because the balsamic vinegar soaks through the bottom half of the bread and makes it a kinda gross mush, so it does not hold up very well. So suck it in and eat up both halfs. You know you want to.\n\nThe sandwich comes absolutely loaded with ingredients! The mozz is fresh, possibly Buffalo, not sure, but definitely not the low moisture stuff. It will come out cold, just like a Caprese salad. Oh and I recommend the potato salad, too.

On to the drinks -- my hubs got the Old Fashioned and I got the Lavender Honey Sangria.  His Old Fashioned was SUPER strong and mine was very light and refreshing.  I think next time, I'll try something else.  Now on to the important part -- the entrees :)\n\nI ordered the lump crab cake with a side Caesar salad.  My daughter and hubs ordered the filet 8oz, he also ordered a side of scallops which we all shared. The crab cake was DELICIOUS and we LOVED the salad.  I loved that the crab cake wasn't encased in breading and deep fried.  It was very flavorful.  The scallops were okay, not the best I've had but I was satisfied.  Now the filet, WOW.  Seasoning was perfect...the meat cut so easy.....and it just melted in your mouth.  \n\nWe followed our dinner with some dessert.  Let me first say that we are typically not dessert folks, but since these were served in small individual sized cups, we just had to try a few.  I ordered the peanut butter pie and my daughter got the cookies and cream.  Both were very good and just big enough to hit the spot.\n\nService was AMAZING!  My hubs booked a reservation for 8:30PM, when we arrived we visited the hostess stand and were taken to a booth within 5 minutes.  Immediately upon sitting we were greeted by a smiling face of our waitress to take our drink orders.  We sat in the bar area and had a few folks wait on us that evening but they didn't skip a beat whatsoever.  Our drinks and food were out in no time!

They also let me know that our \"booking time\" was (I think she said) 1 hour 45 mins (or was it 1.5 hrs?).

The person behind continuously backed his chair into mine.  At one point, his chair caught mine and moved me over 3 inches while I was eating.

We got to take a look at the house and tour the rooms. Right now they have it all decorated for the holidays and it is beautiful!

I can only imagine how colorful it is during the spring and summer! We found our way to the lake where people were feeding the fish. We even managed to find a nice spot on the water to sit and relax. It was amazing! There are also some mazes on the path which were pretty cool too. \n\nI'll have to go back again soon to see the Garden Glow exhibit because walking around in the day time did not do it justice.

We did the tasting menu, which I believe is the best way to go. It's definitely a good deal. We started with the Turkish hummus, salatim (salads) and laffa. We asked for a second laffa because we wolfed our first one down - it was all so delicious! The picked veggies they put on the table upon our arrival were also quite tasty. After the hummus and salatim, we had the fried haloumi (cheese), fried cauliflower, fried sweetbreads, and smoked sable on challah toast. The haloumi was my favorite of the night - it was absolutely incredible. The fried cauliflower was good, but the flavor was nothing special in my mind. The sweetbreads were also tasty, but it tasted like something was missing. The only thing thus far that we didn't like was the sable. I actually wouldn't finish it - the sable itself didn't have good flavor, and the Challah toast tasted stale. For our main courses, I got the mushrooms and the bf got the hangar steak. The mushrooms were really tasty - perfectly cooked, and the lamb bacon was AWESOME. I wish the lamb bacon had been cut into smaller pieces because I actually couldn't distinguish it from the mushrooms. We each ate a whole piece of the bacon in one bite, so we couldn't savor it with the mushrooms. The hangar steak was OK...the flavor was great, but it wasn't hot and it was a bit chewy. For dessert, I got the milk chocolate baklava and my bf got the rugelach. Dessert was nothing memorable - The baklava had a very strong peanut flavor and an orange glaze that I SWEAR wasn't listed on the menu (if it were, I would've asked for it without). The rugelach was good, but not like the Jewish bakeries in town. The pumpkin ice cream that came with the baklava had no taste of pumpkin whatsoever, and the Turkish ice cream that came with the rugelach was good but quite different with the flavor of coriander.\n\nOverall, the food was a 4, but the service brought the experience up to a 5. I'm telling you, it was some of the best service I have ever gotten. The manager walked around and asked each table how the meal was, the server was attentive without nagging.

The ambience is great - classy and sophisticated, yet cozy.\n\nI would definitely recommend Zahav to anyone looking for a tasty, special meal. The flavors of the food were different and overall we really enjoyed our meals.", "date": "2012-01-15 04:08:55"}

Last night the lovely wife and I kicked off Restaurant Week by visiting Amada and as expected, our meal was extraordinary.\n\nDepending on the dictionary Amada translates to darling or beloved.  Whatever the translation, I am in love.  We are no strangers to Garces places and have visited Distrito and JG Domestic several times.  This is also not our first visit here.\n\nOur Open Table reservations were honored perfectly and we were seated about five minutes early.  Our waiter was Harrison and throughout our meal he was competent and friendly.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu included two appetizers, two entrees and a desert each.  So the two of us enjoyed a total of ten plates.  Note to new visitors; five plates each was the perfect number.  We were pleasantly full but not stuffed.\n\nAs we sighed and moaned over each delightful morsel we discovered we had a problem.  We would have a very difficult time deciding which dish or dishes were our favorites.  If you are visiting a tapas restaurant this is exactly the problem you want to face.\n\nIn the interests of brevity I'll mention three wonderful plates.  The Cana De Cabra cheese with fig and cherry marmalade was a perfect appetizer.  My wife's eyes lit up when she had her first taste and I agree.  The Costillas De Ternera Coca (beef shortrib flatbread with horseradish, parmesan and bacon) was beautiful to behold.  The kick from the horseradish worked well with the beef.  Finally the Madre E Hijo (chicken breast with truffles and fried egg) was plated beautifully.  I am a sucker for truffles and I was not disappointed.\n\nAt a Garces restaurant I've learned to expect at least a four star if not a five star experience.  Once again we were blown away.

Perfect. The plan was to swing by, put our name down and then go buy a bottle of bubbly since it's a BYOB brunch. The only problem was that when we got there, two counter spots were available and my big mouth accidentally mentioned the Champaign run. Due to their seating policy, we wouldn't be able to be added to the list. Their policy isn't my reason for the three stars because it is what it is. Take the policy or leave it. I just feel it is fair to include my entire experience in my review. \n\nDisappointedly I left figuring we'd try Caf\u00e9 Lift another day. My husband was determined though, so we made the bubbly run and came back to give it another try. Upon our return, our wait time was about 30-40 minutes ago. We got to waiting and I was quickly losing my patience which is NEVER a good thing when going to a popular brunch spot. We were practically across the street when my name was called about 20 minutes into the wait. It was probably a good thing because I'm not sure if I was going to come back another day to try again.\n\nIt was all up from there. Our server came over fairly quickly and seeing us with a bottle, get us quickly set up for mimosas. Since we had time to review the menu, we were pretty ready to place our order of the special French toast and the Jen's Crespelle. \n\nThe French toast was made with challah bread topped with pumpkin cannoli filling, chipped bittersweet chocolate, and maple-soaked walnuts. The Jen's Crespelle consisted of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and fontina cheese, rolled in an Italian-style crepe and topped with maple syrup.\n\nThe French toast platter was huge so there was more than enough for me to try, and for my husband to still have leftovers. It was almost like eating cake. It was fluffy, sweet and the maple-soaked walnuts were to die for! I couldn't really taste the pumpkin in the cannoli filling though. \n\nThe Jen's Crespelle was the perfect balance for folks who have sweet versus savory decision issues. The crepe was thin but sturdy and housed the egg, bacon and cheese nicely. I typically don't have fontina cheese with my eggs, however it did a great job being melty and blending with the eggs. I couldn't taste any syrup when my platter initially came out, but there was a container on the table so I was able to dress the dish myself. I guess I could do that with any savory dish. I'm storing that trick away for my next brunch outing. There was also a small side of potatoes which were pretty good. They weren't fried and possibly broiled. In any case, they were very fresh. They had a nice, possibly rosemary like seasoning to them and were quite enjoyable.  \n\nAs far as the setting, we were seated right behind the hostess booth. There was enough space between us and the next table, however the restaurant was very loud. This could be due to the high ceilings in the building.  I almost felt like I was screaming at my husband to communicate with. \n\nDespite the initial hiccups, I enjoyed my food and am glad I ended up sticking it out at Caf\u00e9 Lift. However with so many top notch brunch spots in the city, I won't be rushing back.", "date": "2014-10-27 16:40:35"}

This is a special occasion restaurant, great for a dinner date or business meeting or just getting together with friends to celebrate an amazing evening. Plan on spending some money, especially if you order drinks and a bottle or two of wine, but the base price of your steak dinner with all of the trimmings is certainly reasonable.\n\nReservations are a must, and it's wise to make them a week or two out -- especially during busy holiday times, or on the eve of a major event in Tampa (football games, Gasparilla, etc.) As a last-minute option, arrive when they first open at 5pm and ask to sit in the lounge area. They'll even let you sit at the bar, but if your cellphone plays an obnoxious electronic song at top volume every time that you get a message, then expect other people to throw their steakhouse mushrooms at you.\n\nDressing up is also recommended. This is not the place to wear shorts, t-shirts, and flip flops. Save that for your other South Howard hangouts. Show some class and wear long pants, a collared shirt, and even shoes.\n\nIf you have a reservation you'll be seated in one of their many dining rooms, and your server will be right over with the menus. The wait staff at Bern's is at the top of their game, and many of these folks have been with the restaurant for a very long time. If you ask, they'll generally explain that they started working at the company's proprietary farm located in NW Hillsborough county (This is where the vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale and microgreens are grown), after that they rotate through all of the kitchen positions to learn what happens at each station. It often takes a year or more of training before they're allowed out in the dining rooms.\n\nDon't be shy about asking for their recommendations as they truly know their craft. On one of my first trips to the restaurant, my server was a guy named Kurt, and he told all sorts of fascinating stories and made some excellent suggestions that really enhanced our meal. He is one of Bern's veteran servers, and if you end up in his section then you'll be in for a real treat.\n\nOn this last trip to Bern's I met my lovely Yelp wife, Anna M, at the bar where Lynn was showing off some amazing mixology skills. I ordered a bourbon Old Fashioned, and we nibbled daintily on the cheese toasts before ordering the tuna tartare appetizer. Very delicious! Since this was our official 'Ring in the Holidays' special occasion dinner, we were able to sit in Jennifer's section and had a marvelous time visiting with her while we ate. Thanks Jen!\n\nYou can make your dinner as basic or as complex as you like, and your server will be glad to assist. You can start by ordering any appetizers, caviar, soups, or salads. Then with the assistance of the Bern's sommeliers you can select some incredible wines from their massive cellar. We chose a 2012 Joseph Swan Cuvee' de Trois Pinot Noir from the Russian River Valley this past time. An absolutely outstanding wine!\n\nFrom there you select your steak or other entr\u00e9e. Bern's offers six different cuts of steak which are ordered according to overall size and thickness, and then cooked to your specifications. The meat is aged and hand-trimmed, again according to your specifications. Ask your server for help, and don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions. There are all sorts of toppings and sauces that are available, and they'll gladly guide you through the choices.\n\nYour basic meal comes with French onion soup, a tossed greens salad, baked potato, two vegetables of the day, and crispy onion strings -- all for the cost of your steak. Knowing this, a $50 14-ounce Delmonico steaksteak does not seem unreasonable. (Especially considering the potential for leftovers!). Anna and I added the Steakhouse mushrooms and the crispy shiitake mushrooms as a la carte veggies, but otherwise each ordered a big ole honking Delmonico with plans for leftovers the next day.\n\nAfter Jen boxed up our leftovers, she led us back to the kitchen for the legendary tour of the kitchen and the wine cellar. This is fantastic behind-the-scenes opportunity to see how things are prepared, and ask all the questions that you like. Everyone is more than willing to stop and speak with you, and they are genuinely thankful that you're having dinner in their restaurant.\n\nThe wine cellar is jaw-droppingly amazing. You will see bottles of wine costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and your tour guide will point out some of the more interesting vintages, and answer all of your questions.\n\nFrom there you climb the stairs to the Harry Waugh Dessert Room where you'll be seated in one of 48 individual cubbyholes built from redwood wine casks to give you a very private and exclusive table. Riley was our waiter, and he talked me into a warm pineapple upside down cake, covered with roasted pineapple ice cream, and rum sauce. YUM!!!\n\nGo there, enjoy the experience!", "date": "2016-01-08 02:39:58"}

Eat that one.\n\nThe empanadas and tuna tartare tacos are excellent appetizers.\n\nIf you are trying to decide between the honey mustard glazed salmon and the shrimp stew, go with the stew.\n\nThe chocolate cigar is a very good dessert. It is a decadent almond cake wrapped in chocolate mousse that works in perfect harmony with dulce de leche ice cream. That being said, keep your expectations humble if you order this. The 5 stars of this review was earned by the ceviche and not the sweet selections.\n\nFurthermore, Alma de Cuba's happy hour offers some really excellent apps and drinks.

Really no seating available for the people that are waiting.....everyone just stands around or outside. We opted to sit outside on the bench only to be engulfed by smoke from people smoking in the outside eating area. They should really have all areas as non smoking since it's a restaurant area. We were finally buzzed to get our seats....but wait! We handed in our buzzer and had to stand in a separate line for a wait staff to co,e take us to our table. There were 5 parties ahead of us, so another 5 minutes probably. OMG. We were finally seated at the smallest most compact table in the bar area. I totally forgot how cramped the seating is here if you aren't lucky enough to get a booth or private table. The atmosphere is extremely loud ... hard to have a conversation with your table guests.

I enjoy the ribs and only half of each side and take the additional meat and the remaining sides to work the next day for lunch. For me, this is a winning combination. \n\nI love the dry rub on the ribs, so for me there is no need for sauce. The only time I use sauce at Pappy's is for the brisket and pulled pork. My two favorite sauces are the original and Holly's Hot Sauce. I really like the extra kick that Holly gives. I enjoy it especially on the Burnt Ends when I can get them. So many times, by the time I get there after work they are sold out. That tells you just how good those damn burnt ends are. \n\nI always order the same sides. When Pappy first opened, I wasn't a fan of his Baked Beans, but they have won me over and now I order them every time. No matter what meat I am enjoying, the beans are the perfect accompaniment. My second side, I mix it up between Fried Sweet Corn on the Cob and Green Beans. Both are made fresh and taste like they came out of a country kitchen. \n\nLines are long, service is friendly, polite and fast. You can not go wrong eating at Pappy's. \n\nWhen: Multiple after work visits\nWhy: Dinner & next days lunch.", "date": "2016-07-20 18:09:14"}

There is just something about a hand pressed, oddly shaped patty, bursting with flavor to make a breakfast complete.

It was on fire and so was I the rest of the day, but I didn't mind because it was that good.\n\nHowever, as I stated earlier I am not a fan of grits and if they offer Grits on Fire again, I think I'll have them hold the grits and put mine on their famous perfectly crispy home fries.

I'm sure having limited options ensures all their choices are spectacular, but I decided to forgo the ice cream.\n\nLuckily, they have a huge selection of doughnuts as well!

I then dragged three friends to make a forty-minute road trip to get apple fritters at 7 a.m. (I heard they run out fast). When I saw that Dough had apple fritters I was both intrigued and frightened. I already have such a huge bar set for apple fritters was it worth trying it from here and rating the place based on a pastry that is held so dear to my heart?\n\nYes, I got the apple fritter. I usually like my apple fritters more crispy than doughy, but this one really impressed me. It was doughy but it wasn't dry at all. I'm not about to wax poetics about this apple fritter because it would get weird fast, but just know that Dough does dough well. \n\nI would definitely suggest coming here and trying something made of dough.

They are all pretty much the same thing.\n\nAirports, however, are not all pretty much the same thing. Some have lots of character and they can be pretty unique. But Philadelphia seemed to be the average of every airport that I've ever been in. Nothing really stood out. It wasn't really out-dated, but it wasn't super modernized. The Philadelphia Marketplace was kind of neat from afar, but it ended up consisting of a bunch of chains. \n\nThe problem with reviewing airports is that, unless it's your home airport or one you fly into often, you are likely to see only a small percentage of it.

I read a couple of reviews, but I still hadn't really checked out their menu and wasn't quite sure what to expect. \n\nHaving never been to Chipotle, I didn't quite get the \"Italian Chipotle\" references. Essentially, Piada keeps their menu pretty basic including seasonal specials, a variety of piadas (sort of an Italian flatbread, though my impression was more of an Italian burrito). They also offer salads, pastas, a few side options and Italian sodas/teas in addition to the usual soft drink options.\n\nThe restaurant here has three accessible parking spots including at least two that are clearly ADA compliant. The sidewalk is level to the ground meaning no curb cut was needed. The front door is a tad heavy - given the layout of the design, you're unlikely to be seen by an employee if help is needed. As you enter, you go right into a line. The line moves at a casual pace - not quickly but also not slowly. However, if you're expecting a super quick take-out you'll be a touch disappointed. Menus are conveniently located in a couple of places along the lines. This helps newcomers, though I did still have a bit of confusion by the time I arrived at the line. You order, in my case a \"Tuscan Piada\" with an additional upcharge for a handful of ingredients. I also ordered a side of garlic dough because, well, garlic. I love garlic. \n\nIt's definitely possible to eat for under $10 here, though that's without any extras. I think the $10-15 range is more accurate. \n\nThe food is served fairly quickly. I opted to try their Italian iced teas (lemon and peach on this day). The tables and overall interior serve up a sort of Italian villa design with some outdoor dining available. \n\nThe garlic dough was terrific, though not what I expected. The piada is a good-sized serving with obviously quality ingredients. It had more of a kick than I expected, while the chicken tenderloin added was mostly unnecessary. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't something that had me thinking \"How have I missed this place all this time?\"\n\nThe service was fine, though not much above average. Even when I said that this was my first visit, there was no offer of explanation or any other sense of hospitality. The ice dispenser was empty by the time I returned for a refill and there seemed to be no rush to refill it. \n\nPiada was a fine option in my endeavor to eat healthier. The customers, in particular, were quite friendly and the business at this location obviously attracts a more upscale clientele. So, yeah, I was kind of out of place. \n\nAs I left, I noted that the exit door had a definite stick to it. I had to really push to open it and someone with upper body weakness would likely struggle a bit. \n\nWhile I wouldn't argue with a friend wanting to meet here for lunch, Piada is not an establishment that will find a place on my regular rotation.", "date": "2017-08-20 15:13:48"}

I went to Brunch on April 15th and was to sit at one of the hightop tables in the front window. When I called to make my reservation, Tori the dining room manager answered the phone and was very perky and pleasant. She asked me if the hightop would be acceptable and I responded, yes. When she asked for my name, I admit I did use an alias. I figured they'd be on the alert for a Steven and I did not  want special treatment. Once I gave my name, she commented that she thought I had been there before, but I said \"no this will be my first\". (I think they knew it was me)\n\nWhen I arrived that Sunday morning, I was seated at the hightop close to the hostess stand. It was comfortable and I had great light for reading, since I was dining alone. \nI love a Bloody Mary at Brunch, HWK calls them a Bloody Wilbur. Their twist has; Bacon Vodka with tomato juice and garnished with pickled asparagus.  I was famished, so I ordered two entrees; Biscuits and Gravy and Eggs Benedict. \n\nAfter I place my order, John the husband of Cassy approached my table and asked me if I were the Steven from Yelp. Yes, I was busted and I wasn't surprised.  Part of being a good Yelper is taking ownership of your reviews, so with a smile I acknowledged who I was. Our conversation was very pleasant and as Cassy (his wife and executive chef) said to me in private messaging they are thankful I brought the single seating to their attention and apologetic my previous experience. \n\nNow let's talk food, after all that is what restaurant reviews are all about.  I'll break it down item for item. \n\nBloody Wilbur: Love the bacon vodka, proving everything is better with bacon. I also enjoyed the the garnish of pickled asparagus. Asparagus is my all-time favorite vegetable so adding it to a brunch cocktail, is A-Okay in my book. Their choice of tomato juice, held this drink back from being spectacular. The juice was weak, a rich and thicker type tomato juice have made this classic brunch cocktail truly pop. \n\nBiscuits and Gravy: They made this old farm boy proud. These truly were some kick ass, B&G. A picture is suppose to be worth a 1000 words, but B&G do not photograph well. So let me tell you the best I can. When you have buttermilk biscuits with chives and cheddar topped with gravy containing huge chunks of sausage - it does not get any better. These Biscuits and Gravy will be added to my Yelp list of Best B&G. \n\nMimosa: Meyer Lemon is a staple in my kitchen/bar at home. So when I saw that they use it for their mimosa, I was already sold. I found the the sparkling wine served with the Meyer Lemon and honey to be a refreshing twist to traditional Mimosa. Two thumbs up and remember I am dining alone. \n\nEggs Benedict: No English Muffin, they use a Grits Cake instead which gives an original twist. I'm not a fan of grits and I enjoyed the difference in texture and flavor. The eggs were poached perfectly and the use of Tasso gives it a Cajun kick. They then top it off with a Spicy Hollandaise and Flash Fried Spinach. \n\nI'm glad I finally got to experience HWK and I'll be back for a lunch soon. My rating is more of a 3 1/2 Star (wish Yelp would let us do 1/2's soon). If Wilbur would have been bloody better, it would of been a 4.", "date": "2012-04-21 17:43:23"}

We have the ribeye, campechano, shrimp, pastor, carnitas, chorizo, and lengua. This strange name but who care. The most important is they good or not.

I parked near the Bay Street (outdoor food court) section of the Mall, and figured that I'd grab something for dinner after I finished shopping. I thought I could find a nice entr\u00e9e salad or a light pasta dish, and not blow my budget in the process.\n\nAs I'm wandering along past all of the eateries and drinking establishments of Bay Street I spotted a long-lost friend at the end of the walkway -- The Cheesecake Factory. I haven't eaten at a CF in ages, but I had heard they now have a \"lighter\" SkinnyLiscious menu as well as some small plate specials, and I figured that was worth a try. Lots of things looked interesting on their menu, but I ended up with a plate of Saut\u00e9ed Shrimp served over Angel Hair Pasta. My entr\u00e9e was 5 large shrimp saut\u00e9ed with herbs, lemon and garlic, and then plated atop Angel Hair pasta, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. This was teensy bit more than the 450 calorie offerings on the SkinnyLiscious menu, but it was very tasty, and not coated in oil or a heavy sauce.\n\nThe menu at the Cheesecake Factory is positively huge with a little bit of everything to appeal to a wide range of tastes. On the weekends the wait to be seated can be up to an hour, and plenty of people are determined to stand there and wait for their table. I can't get excited about waiting that long to get seated in a standard chain restaurant, but that's just my opinion.\n\nNow the main reason that people flock to the Cheesecake Factory is for their desserts, and if you hope to maintain any dignity and self-respect, you'll skip right over this section of the menu and just order a small luncheon salad and a glass of water. Unfortunately, the vast majority of their patrons flip right to the two page listing of the various types of cheesecake (I'm guessing 50 or so), and fixate on dessert as they wolf down their meals.\n\nNot to fear my friends as you can walk to the bakery counter and order your slices of cheesecake to go, and take this delicacy back to your office or to your home, and savor every morsel in complete privacy. Half the fun is watching your fellow diners drooling over all of the choices as they try to decide which one (OK, maybe two) slice(s) will be going home with them.\n\nThankfully I maintained my composure at dinner and just had the pasta. But I sure would like to know how that to-go bag with a slice of Key Lime pie cheesecake ended up on the front seat of my SUV as I pulled out of the Mall's parking lot....", "date": "2013-09-04 02:38:26"}

Then you take a look at the menu and order, cafeteria-style. \n\nI visited SugarFire a few times, and every time, I was blown away by the quality of the food.

All amazing. \n\nIf you're going to order dessert here (and you better!) go with any of their boozy shakes and/or the crack pie. Don't ask me what's in the crack pie.

Fine by me! \n\nThe service here is incredible, and the prices are great. \n\nDon't wait in the long lines at Pappy's or Bogarts. I'm not telling you NOT to visit those places, but go to SugarFire first. \n\nWhen I come back to visit STL in August, I'm heading straight from the airport to SugarFire.

It was served with a sort of spicy jalapeno sauce, which was good. It was hard to taste the conch in the dish, which was a bit disappointing, but they were tasty nonetheless. \n\nNext up we tried the chilled roast beef. It was served with truffle oil infused whipped cream, horseradish panna cotta, au jus, and lavash. This was delicious. I LOVE horseradish, and the panna cotta was quite amazing. \n\nFor my entree, I went with the bacon wrapped meatloaf, which was fantastic.

OK, surely there was one another 25 feet away the way, you know, it is in airports.\n\n I walked...kept walking...all the way to baggage. Not a bathroom on the way. Halfway through the baggage hall, I decided I needed to find one STAT. There was one tucked behind the stairs...with another long line. CURSES!!!!! I ran up the stairs, no, really, running was now necessary. I found a bathroom...BOARDED UP! WTFF?! \n\nThis is unacceptable! Even the very lacking in amenities Kansas City airport has bathrooms a-plenty. Truly, I'd rank Louis Armstrong as *worse* than LaGuardia in this respect. \n\nSo, beware, my friends and make sure you hit the loo while still a mile high. \n\nOther than this huge issue, I'll give them an A-OK. Security isn't a nightmare. Airport personnel seem pleasant enough. There's a fair amount of coffee/food/booze options (hello, this is New Orleans, so there better be!) *before* you get past security. I also can't deny that upon landing, the happiness I feel to be back would otherwise eclipse almost any annoyance. \n\nI bet your wondering about my fate that day...? No, I didn't wet my bloomers. I was able to find another tiny bathroom tucked away...I couldn't tell you where. Suffice to say that it's not that easy to find as it was the only one without a line.", "date": "2010-12-08 18:08:48"}

Between the Farm to Table practice and the extensive and very reasonably priced wine list, the experience is a dream.  Sure, the place is decorated like Disney's Haunted Castle and it's a nightmare actually getting a table, but the food is wonderful.  And the service!  We were served by Matt last night, and he was one of the best waiters I've ever had.  He was warm and friendly but also very knowledgeable about the food.  The sommolier was also really great.  There was nothing pretentious about this place.  \n\nI am biased as a Californian, but it's amazing being able to have a 41 year old Rioja and a beautiful steak cooked for two and very tasty crab cakes for less than $250.  I pay a lot more for a 2005 bottle and mediocre food and crappy service in San Francisco.", "date": "2011-01-23 19:00:37"}

The chicken breast with truffles was very good flavor, but the chicken was slightly dry. Our least favorite of the evening was the grilled beef brochettes - great flavor, but the meat was REALLY tough. The food was all solid good, but I didn't notice any magnificent flavors that I've never tasted before, which is what I need to taste to give 5 stars.

I remember every time I make a trip to Orlando, I have the carry out from this smokehouse BBQ restaurant. Now I can sit and eat the food at the restaurant since they open one in tampa. It Is long wait but worthies for the wait. \n\nTonight (Friday night) is one of the longer restaurant hour night that they have until 9 pm. We arrive at 6:27pm and the wait line build up to sidewalk of the restaurant side. The wait on the line is 25 minute. The different of this restaurant is they built their sweet item at different side of the order line. This actually reduce the wait time compare to the one at winter park location. This is a improvement. While we were waiting on the line the server bring up the small ketchup cup size try item six shooter for the taste. \n\nWe have order the Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak and Smoke Prime Rib. We have added the half pound signature brisket. The side are the collar green, corn, sweet potato smash, and the bacon wrap jalape\u00f1o. The taste did not change from the original restaurant (Fairbanks Winter Park). The prime rib is juicy and tender. The brisket is well seasoning that enter to the meat it self. I love their their side because they extra effort to process it. If you fist time here, you should start with their brisket. \n\nIf you come here to have a nice dinner, this is not the place. You should come here just for the food since your food is serve on top of paper on the tray. It is BBQ joint that you need to get down or chow down. Expecting line will build up to the door.", "date": "2014-12-27 01:01:06"}

This place has become a tourist mecca so I try to stay away as much as I can but there are some redeeming qualities to this place other than their tasteless roast beef and their flash fried shrimp that loses its breading. I have two favorites that I have found on their menu that are consistently great. The corned beef poboy dressed is excellent. The corned beef is shipped in from the Fairgrounds old Chicago supplier and brings me back to the old days of the racetrack. Tender perfectly cooked corned beef on toasted french bread dressed, its so good!!! The other favorite of mine is the seasonal Thanksgiving Day poboy served only on Wednesday's in November. House roasted turkey, dressing, cranberry sauce and oh yes extra turkey gravy. Both of those sandwiches are the bomb.", "date": "2017-10-24 16:42:01"}

It seems they keep the sound on the games relatively down or mute until a big game is about to air, and they switch to an overhead sound system for the audio.\n\nIt does get very noisy, and smoking was allowed everywhere it seemed, but ventilation was decent.\n\nThe baked wings were pretty good.  We got them plain with our sauces on the side.  10 wings were about $8.49.  I had a gyro for $8.49, which was good, and normally comes with fries, but I paid $1.29 to get a side salad instead.  My husband had the blackened tuna ($8.99), which he really liked and opted to pay $1.29 extra to get onion rings instead of fries.  Their version of onion rings had a very soft breading (no crispness at all), and we did not prefer them...perhaps others would.\n\nPluses about the bar.  They have Guiness, Woodchuck Cider, Blue Moon, Coors Light, Fat Tire, Schlafly and Bud products on tap!!!  That's in addition to a healthy bottled beer selection.\n\nDespite being extremely short-handed in the kitchen and crowded to the max with customers, our server had a very good demeanor and attitude.  She was really trying and apologetic about our wait.\n\nIf you're trying to get a good seat for the game, I would park myself in front of the newer LG plasmas and not the big-screen projector, because you'll get better color and crispness on the plasmas.  If there are only 2 or 3 of you, grab seats at the bar.  Your drinks will stay full and cold and there are 3 TVs right in front of you.", "date": "2010-02-28 21:53:07"}

I cannot comment on its sandwiches, which most people go there specifically for, but their salads are absolutely marvelous!\n\nFirst, I have to mention that I cannot offer a stronger suggestion than to use their texting reservation system.  My mom was driving from Orlando and I heard that Datz can be busy on Sunday at lunch.  Originally, we tried to make a reservation through Open Table, but they were booked at the time we wanted and we would have to wait till after 2 p.m. for a reservation!  I went on its website and noticed that I could text them to get on the waiting list for a table.  I did and it said we would have a table in 20 minutes.  My mom was running late so I took us off the list.  I had 30 minutes to put my name back on at the spot I was at!  Long story short, I kept texting to be put back in line and texting to be taken out until we were in front of the restaurant and the moment we walked in, my phone buzzed that our table was ready!  Amazing.\n\nOn Sunday they only serve brunch, but there are still a plethora of choices.  My mom got the Figgy Piggy Salad and it was superb!  The dressing is to die for with great chunks of bacon.  I got the High Steaks Caesar.  When it said it came with beef tips, I was thinking strips of beef.  Boy was I wrong.  They were perfectly cooked beef chunks on skewers.  It made the entire salad worth it.  They did not even ask me how I wanted it cooked, they knew to make it medium rare.  Both salads came with delicious looking hunks of bread, but we both abstained since we're going to have to fit into New Year dresses soon.\n\nAs people have written, parking is terrible.  There is parking in the back, but it is hardly enough.  While we were there, a man came over the sound system to say that two cars were about to be towed!  Definitely come early if you want a parking spot within walking distance.", "date": "2012-12-20 02:32:26"}
